      "{0: {'mutual_fund_name': 'NASDAQ 100 INDEX FUND Ticker Symbols NASDX NDXKX and NQQQX', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund’s investment objective is to attempt to replicate the performance of the largest non financial companies as measured by the Nasdaq 100 Index®.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Nasdaq 100 Index® includes 100 of the largest domestic and international non financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization. Nasdaq which maintains the Index makes all determinations regarding the inclusion of stocks in the Index. Each stock is weighted in proportion to its total market value. The Fund is passively managed. It invests primarily in the stocks comprising the Index so that the weighting of each stock in the portfolio approximates the Index. Shelton Capital Management the investment advisor to the Fund seeks to maintain a return correlation of at least 0.95 to the Nasdaq 100 Index® (a return correlation of 1.00 is perfect). Under normal market conditions it is the Fund’s policy to invest at least 80 of its total assets (which includes the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in the stocks comprising the Index. The Fund may invest in securities issued by other investment companies if those companies invest in securities consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and policies. Companies included in The Nasdaq 100 Index range from 15 billion to 2 413 billion in market capitalization as of November 30 2021. The majority of portfolio transactions in the Fund (other than those made in response to shareholder activity) will be made to adjust the Fund’s portfolio to track the Index or to reflect occasional changes in the Index’s composition. The Fund may invest in futures contracts which are a type of derivative. The Fund generally maintains some short term securities and cash equivalents in the portfolio to meet redemptions and needs for liquidity. Shelton will typically buy futures contracts so that the market value of the futures replicates the difference between the net assets of the fund and the equity holdings. This helps minimize the tracking error of the Fund. 3 The Fund may become “non diversified” as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended solely as a result of a change in relative market capitalizations or index weightings of one or more stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index®. This means that the Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in a limited number of issuers than would be the case if the Fund were always managed as a diversified management investment company. The Fund intends to be diversified in approximately the same proportion as the Nasdaq 100 Index®. Shareholder approval will not be sought when the Fund crosses from diversified to non diversified status due solely to a change in the relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of the Nasdaq 100 Index®.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'You could lose money by investing in the Fund and the Fund could underperform other investments. You should expect the Fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The Fund’s performance could be hurt by Equity Risk. Equity securities can be volatile and may decline in value because of changes in the actual or perceived financial condition of their issuers or other events affecting their issuers. The Fund’s target index may at times become focused in stocks of a particular sector category or group of companies which could cause Fund to underperform the overall stock market. Market Exposure Risk. Investment prices may increase or decrease sometimes suddenly and unpredictably due to general market conditions. The Fund primarily invests in U.S. stocks and is designed to track the overall performance of the Nasdaq 100 Index®. In an attempt to accurately represent the Index the Fund will typically not take steps to reduce its market exposure. Concentration Risk. The Nasdaq 100 Index is subject to concentration risk. First it is a modified capitalization weighted index meaning that except for some modifications companies are weighted based on their size. Thus the poor performance of the largest companies within the Index could result in the negative performance of the Index and the Fund. Additionally the significant concentration of technology stocks makes the Fund’s performance particularly sensitive to this specific sector. Negative performance in the technology sector will result in negative Fund performance. Non Diversification Risk. To the extent the Fund is managed as a non diversified investment company it is subject to the greater risk that the value of a specific security can perform differently from the market as a whole for reasons related to the issuer such as operational performance financial leverage and investment level performance. The value of the Fund may decrease in response to the activities and financial prospects of an individual security in the Fund’s portfolio. Additionally the Fund may be subject to greater risk because the Fund’s performance may be more sensitive to any single economic business political or regulatory occurrence than the value of shares of a diversified investment company. Economic and Political Risks. These effects may be short term by causing a change in the market that is corrected in a year or less or they may have long term impacts which may cause changes in the market that may last for many years. Some factors may affect changes in one sector of the economy or one stock but don’t have an impact on the overall market. The particular sector of the economy or the individual stock may be affected for a short or long term. Derivatives Risk. Investing with derivatives such as options and equity index futures or other futures contracts involves risks additional to and possibly greater than those associated with investing directly in securities. The value of a derivative may not correlate to the value of the underlying instrument to the extent expected. Derivative transactions may be volatile and can create leverage which could cause the Fund to lose more than the amount of assets initially contributed to the transaction if any. The Fund may not be able to close a derivatives position at an advantageous time or price. For over the counter derivatives transactions the counterparty may be unable or unwilling to make required payments and deliveries especially during times of financial market distress. Changes in regulation relating to a mutual fund’s use of derivatives and related instruments may make derivatives more costly limit the availability of derivatives or otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives and the Fund. Non U.S. Investment Risk. Securities of non U.S. issuers (including ADRs and other securities that represent interests in a non U.S. issuer’s securities) may be less liquid more volatile and harder to value than U.S. securities. Non U.S. issuers may be subject to political economic or market instability or unfavorable government action in their local jurisdictions or economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by U.S. or foreign regulators. There may be less information publicly available about non U.S. issuers and their securities and those issuers may be subject to lower levels of government regulation and oversight. Non U.S. stock markets may decline due to conditions specific to an individual country including unfavorable economic conditions relative to the United States. There may be increased risk of delayed transaction settlement or security certificate loss. Stock Futures Risk. Although the Fund’s primary risks are associated with changes in the stock market there are other risks associated with the Fund. These risks generally apply to how well the Fund tracks the Index. For example the Fund invests in futures contracts to the extent that it holds cash in the portfolio. If these futures contracts do not track the Index the Fund’s performance relative to the Index will change. Cybersecurity Risk. Cybersecurity incidents may allow an unauthorized party to gain access to Fund assets customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or cause the Fund the Advisor and or other service providers (including custodians sub custodians transfer agents and financial intermediaries) to suffer data breaches data corruption or loss of operational functionality. In an extreme case a shareholder’s ability to exchange or redeem Fund shares may be affected. 4 COVID 19 Risk. The impact of COVID 19 (and the variants of such virus) and other epidemics and pandemics that may arise in the future could affect the economies of many nations individual companies their securities (including equity and debt) and the market in general in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen at the present time. Health crises caused by the recent coronavirus outbreak may exacerbate other pre existing political social financial and economic risks in certain countries. The impact of the outbreak may last for an extended period of time.'}}\n",
      "{0: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS ALL CAP VALUE FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks to provide long term growth of capital primarily through investment in equity securities.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund pursues its objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of equity securities such as common stocks of issuers across the capitalization spectrum and identified by the Adviser as having value characteristics. The Adviser examines various factors in determining the value characteristics of such issuers including price to book value ratios and price to earnings ratios. These value characteristics are examined in the context of the issuer’s operating and financial fundamentals such as return on equity and earnings growth and cash flow. The Adviser selects securities for the Fund based on a continuous study of trends in industries and companies earnings power and growth and other investment criteria. The Adviser will sell a stock when it no longer meets one or more investment criteria either through obtaining target value or due to an adverse change in fundamentals or business momentum. Each holding has a target valuation established at purchase which the Adviser constantly monitors and adjusts as appropriate. The Fund may also invest up to 20 of its total assets in non U.S. dollar denominated securities. The Fund may invest up to 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments including investments that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale. The Fund may participate as a purchaser in initial public offerings of securities (“IPO”). An IPO is a company’s first offering of stock to the public. The Fund may invest up to 10 of its net assets in securities that can be converted into common stock such as certain debt securities and preferred stock. The Fund may hedge overall portfolio exposure up to 40 of its net assets through the purchase and sale of index and individual put and call options. In general the Fund’s investments are broadly diversified over a number of industries and as a matter of policy the Fund is limited to investing less than 25 of its total assets in any one industry. While the Adviser intends to fully invest the Fund’s assets at all times in accordance with the above mentioned policies the Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and eligible U.S. dollar denominated money market instruments and make investments inconsistent with its investment objective. The Adviser will determine when market conditions warrant temporary defensive measures.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The Fund’s principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to facilitate finding particular risks and comparing them with other funds. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. 4 ● Convertible Securities Risk. Securities that can be converted into common stock such as certain securities and preferred stock are subject to the usual risks associated with fixed income investments such as interest rate risk and credit risk. In addition because they react to changes in the value of the equity securities into which they will convert convertible securities are also subject to the risks associated with equity securities. ● Cyber Security Risk. Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or its investment adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● Foreign Custody Risk. The Fund may hold foreign securities and cash with foreign banks agents and securities depositories appointed by the Fund’s custodian (each a “Foreign Custodian”). Some Foreign Custodians may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business. In some countries Foreign Custodians may be subject to little or no regulatory oversight over or independent evaluation of their operations. Further the laws of certain countries may place limitations on the Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a Foreign Custodian enters bankruptcy. Investments in emerging markets may be subject to even greater custody risks than investments in more developed markets. Custody services in emerging market countries are very often undeveloped and may be considerably less well regulated than in more developed countries and thus may not afford the same level of investor protection as would apply in developed countries. ● Foreign Securities Risk. International investing may be subject to special risks including but not limited to currency exchange rate volatility political social or economic instability less publicly available information less stringent investor protections and differences in taxation auditing and other financial practices. Foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be traded in markets that close before the time that the Fund calculates its net asset value (“NAV”). Furthermore certain foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not calculate its NAV. As a result the value of the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. ● Illiquid Investments Risk. Investing in illiquid investments is subject to certain risks such as limitations on resale and uncertainty in determining valuation. Limitations on resale may adversely affect the marketability of portfolio securities and the Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid investments promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days. The Fund might in order to dispose of restricted securities have to register securities resulting in additional expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of such securities. 5 ● IPO Risk. IPO risk is the risk that the market value of IPO shares will fluctuate considerably due to certain factors such as the absence of a prior public market unseasoned trading the small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer. The purchase of IPO shares may involve high transaction costs. IPO shares are subject to market risk and liquidity risk. When the Fund’s asset base is small a significant portion of the Fund’s performance could be attributable to investments in IPOs because such investments would have a magnified impact on the Fund. As the Fund’s assets grow the effect of the Fund’s investments in IPOs on the Fund’s performance probably will decline which could reduce the Fund’s performance. Because of the price volatility of IPO shares the Fund may choose to hold IPO shares for a very short period of time. This may increase the turnover of the Fund’s portfolio and may lead to increased expenses to the Fund such as commissions and transaction costs. In addition the Adviser cannot guarantee continued access to IPOs. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. In other words the individual stocks in the Fund may not perform as well as expected and or the Fund’s portfolio management practices do not work to achieve their desired result. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the prices of these stocks will not move even lower. ● Micro Cap Companies Risk. Micro cap stocks may be very sensitive to changing economic conditions and market downturns because the issuers often have narrow markets for their products or services fewer product lines and more limited managerial and financial resources than larger issuers. The stocks of micro cap companies may therefore be more volatile and the ability to sell them at a desirable time or price may be more limited. ● Mid Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of mid sized companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than stocks of larger more established companies. ● Options Risk. An option is a type of derivative instrument that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy (a “call”) or sell (a “put”) an asset in the near future at an agreed upon price prior to the expiration date of the option. The Fund may “cover” a call option by owning the security underlying the option or through other means. The value of options can be highly volatile and their use can result in loss if the Adviser is incorrect in its expectation of price fluctuations. ● Small Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of smaller companies may be subject to more abrupt erratic market movements than stocks of larger more established companies. Small companies may have limited product lines or financial resources or may be dependent on a small or inexperienced management group and their securities may trade less frequently and in lower volume than securities of larger companies which could lead to higher transaction costs. Generally the smaller the company size the greater the risk.'}, 1: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS SMALL CAP VALUE FUND II', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks to provide long term growth of capital primarily through investment in equity securities.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund pursues its objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of equity securities such as common stocks of issuers with small market capitalizations and identified by the Adviser as having value characteristics. A small market capitalization issuer generally is considered to be one whose market capitalization is at the time the Fund makes the investment similar to the market capitalization of companies in the Russell 2000® Value Index. The Russell 2000® Value Index is an unmanaged index that contains stocks from the Russell 2000® Index with less than average growth orientation. As of November 30 2021 the median market capitalization of the Russell 2000® Value Index was 1.0 billion and the largest stock was 18.3 billion. Please note that this range is as of a particular point in time and is subject to change. The Fund generally invests in the equity securities of small companies. The Adviser will seek to invest in companies it considers to be well managed and to have attractive fundamental financial characteristics. The Adviser believes greater potential for price appreciation exists among small companies since they tend to be less widely followed by other securities analysts and thus may be more likely to be undervalued by the market. The Fund may invest from time to time a portion of its assets not to exceed 20 (under normal conditions) at the time of purchase in companies with larger market capitalizations. The Adviser examines various factors in determining the value characteristics of such issuers including price to book value ratios and price to earnings ratios. These value characteristics are examined in the context of the issuer’s operating and financial fundamentals such as return on equity earnings growth and cash flow. The Adviser selects securities for the Fund based on a continuous study of trends in industries and companies earnings power and growth and other investment criteria. The Adviser will sell a stock when it no longer meets one or more investment criteria either through obtaining target value or due to an adverse change in fundamentals or business momentum. Each holding has a target valuation established at purchase which the Adviser constantly monitors and adjusts as appropriate. The Fund may also invest up to 25 of its total assets in non U.S. dollar denominated securities. The Fund may invest up to 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments including investments that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale. The Fund may participate as a purchaser in initial public offerings of securities (“IPO”). An IPO is a company’s first offering of stock to the public. In general the Fund’s investments are broadly diversified over a number of industries and as a matter of policy the Fund is limited to investing a maximum of 25 of its total assets in any one industry. While the Adviser intends to fully invest the Fund’s assets at all times in accordance with the above mentioned policies the Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and eligible U.S. dollar denominated money market instruments and make investments inconsistent with its investment objective. The Adviser will determine when market conditions warrant temporary defensive measures.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The Fund’s principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to facilitate finding particular risks and comparing them with other funds. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● Cyber Security Risk. Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or its investment adviser.

The Fund might in order to dispose of restricted securities have to register securities resulting in additional expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of such securities. Less liquid securities that the Fund may want to invest in may be difficult or impossible to purchase. Federal banking regulations may also cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of certain securities which may further decrease the Fund’s ability to buy or sell such securities. 11 ● IPO Risk. IPO risk is the risk that the market value of IPO shares will fluctuate considerably due to certain factors such as the absence of a prior public market unseasoned trading the small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer.

The Fund will invest in smaller issuers which are more volatile and less liquid than investments in issuers with a market capitalization greater than the market capitalization of companies in the Russell 2000® Value Index. Small market capitalization issuers are not as diversified in their business activities as issuers with market capitalizations greater than the market capitalization of companies in the Russell 2000® Value Index and are more susceptible to changes in the business cycle. The small capitalization equity securities in which the Fund invests may be traded only in the over the counter market or on a regional securities exchange may be listed only in the quotation service commonly known as the “pink sheets ” and may not be traded every day or in the volume typical of trading on a national securities exchange. These securities may also be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The trading market for any given small capitalization equity security may be sufficiently small as to make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a substantial block of such securities. The sale by the Fund of portfolio securities to meet redemptions may require the Fund to sell its small capitalization securities at a discount from market prices or during periods when in the Adviser’s judgment such sale is not desirable. Moreover the lack of an efficient market for these securities may make them difficult to value.'}, 2: {'mutual_fund_name': 'WPG PARTNERS SELECT SMALL CAP VALUE FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks to provide long term capital appreciation.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund pursues its objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of U.S. companies that at the time of purchase have a market capitalization that is within the range of the market capitalization of issuers in the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index. As of November 30 2021 the median market capitalization of the companies in the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index is 1.0 billion and the largest stock is 17.4 billion. The Fund may invest in depositary receipts and equity securities of foreign companies. Although the Fund invests primarily in common stocks (which include both exchange listed and over the counter ( OTC ) securities) the Fund may invest in all types of equity and equity related securities including (without limitation) •Securities convertible into common stocks. •Shares of real estate investment trusts ( REITs ). •Warrants and rights to purchase common stocks. •Preferred stocks. •Exchange traded limited partnerships.

Special situations include significant technological improvements or important discoveries reorganizations recapitalizations or mergers favorable resolutions of litigation new management or material changes in company policies and actual or potential changes in control of a company. Strategies The Adviser uses a value approach to select the Fund s investments. Using this investment style the Adviser seeks securities selling at substantial discounts to their underlying values and then holds these securities until the market values reflect what the Adviser believes to be their intrinsic values. The Adviser employs a bottom up strategy focusing on undervalued industries that the Adviser believes are experiencing positive change. The Adviser then uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to assess a security s potential value.

Securities that can be converted into common stock such as certain securities and preferred stock are subject to the usual risks associated with fixed income investments such as interest rate risk and credit risk. In addition because they react to changes in the value of the equity securities into which they will convert convertible securities are also subject to the risks associated with equity securities. •Cyber Security Risk. Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions.

Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. •Equity Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in or have exposure to equity securities. Equity securities tend to be more volatile than other investment choices such as debt and money market instruments. The value of your investment may decrease in response to overall stock market movements or the value of individual securities. •Foreign Custody Risk. The Fund may hold foreign securities and cash with foreign banks agents and securities depositories appointed by the Fund’s custodian (each a “Foreign Custodian”). Some Foreign Custodians may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business. In some countries Foreign Custodians may be subject to little or no regulatory oversight over or independent evaluation of their operations. Further the laws of certain countries may place limitations on the Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a Foreign Custodian enters bankruptcy. •Foreign Securities Risk.

The Fund is a recently organized diversified management investment company with a limited operating history. In addition there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size in which case the Board of the Company may determine to liquidate the Fund. •Non Diversification Risk. The Fund is non diversified. Compared to other funds the Fund may invest more of its assets in a smaller number of companies. Gains or losses on a single stock may have greater impact on the Fund. •OTC Risk. Securities traded on OTC markets are not listed and traded on an organized exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ). Generally the volume of trading in an unlisted or OTC common stock is less than the volume of trading in an exchange listed stock. As a result the market liquidity of some stocks in which the Fund invests may not be as great as that of exchange listed stocks and if the Fund were to dispose of such stocks the Fund may have to offer the shares at a discount from recent prices or sell the shares in small lots over an extended period of time. In addition penny stocks and pink sheet stocks can be classified as OTC stocks. •REITs Risk. REITs may be affected by economic forces and other factors related to the real estate industry. These risks include possible declines in the value of real estate possible lack of availability of mortgage funds and unexpected vacancies of properties. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers self liquidation interest rate risks (especially mortgage REITs) and liquidity risk. REITs that invest in real estate mortgages are also subject to prepayment risk. Investing in REITs may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies. REITs may have limited financial resources may trade less frequently and in a limited volume engage in dilutive offerings and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically small capitalization stocks such as REITs have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in the S P 500® Index. In addition REITs could possibly fail to (i) qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable tax law or (ii) maintain their exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended. •Rights and Warrants Risk. The purchase of rights or warrants involves the risk that the Fund could lose the purchase value of a right or warrant if the right to subscribe to additional shares is not executed prior to the right s or warrant s expiration. Also the purchase of rights and or warrants involves the risk that the effective price paid for the right and or warrant added to the subscription price of the related security may exceed the value of the subscribed security s market price such as when there is no movement in the level of the underlying security. •Small Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of smaller companies may be subject to more abrupt erratic market movements than stocks of larger more established companies. Small companies may have limited product lines or financial resources or may be dependent on a small or inexperienced management group and their securities may trade less frequently and in lower volume than securities of larger companies which could lead to higher transaction costs. Generally the smaller the company size the greater the risk. 18 •Special Situations Risk. The Fund will seek to benefit from special situations such as mergers reorganizations or other unusual events expected to affect a particular issuer.

Under normal market conditions the Fund invests significantly (ordinarily at least 40 — unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the Adviser in which case the Fund would invest at least 30 ) in non U.S. companies. The Fund principally will be invested in issuers located in countries with developed securities markets. The Fund will allocate its assets among various regions and countries including the United States (but in no less than three different countries). Under normal circumstances the Fund will invest at least 80 of its net assets including borrowings for investment purposes in companies that meet the Adviser’s sustainability criteria. Fund holdings must have received at least a “satisfactory” sustainability rating by the Adviser’s Sustainability and Engagement Team (the “Sustainability Team”) based on the Sustainability Team’s written research analysis. The Sustainability Team assesses each holding as either “excellent ” “good ” “satisfactory ” or “poor.” An issuer will be rated “excellent” if the issuer in the opinion of the Sustainability Team has a well developed sustainability structure well designed goals for the future demonstrated successful implementation of its sustainability program and shareholder friendly corporate governance. The Sustainability Team will rate an issuer as “good” if the issuer in the opinion of the Sustainability Team has attributes similar to those described in “excellent” but has some deficiencies that warrant improvement. The Sustainability Team will rate an issuer as “satisfactory” if the issuer in the opinion of the Sustainability Team has a sustainability program in place has a sufficient level of sustainability disclosure for the Sustainability Team to assess the issuer’s sustainability program and has a commitment to improve its sustainability program and disclosure in the near term. All other holdings assessed by the Sustainability Team that are not rated either “excellent” “good” or “satisfactory” are rated “poor”. These ratings are subjective and may vary if the issuer has products or services that inherently promote sustainability particularly for other products or services or has engaged in conduct that has or has the potential to lower the sustainability reputation of the issuer in the opinion of the Sustainability Team. 27 The Sustainability Team uses a positive screen to identify issuers it considers to have characteristics that meet the Adviser’s sustainability criteria. The Sustainability Team assesses the sustainability of the issuer’s products services and operations through original research and focusing on key areas such as corporate governance internal sustainability structure workforce and management diversity training and employee development opportunities safety programs and injury metrics environmental effects such as goals and metrics for greenhouse gas emissions energy usage renewable energy waste and water supplier oversight and litigation and regulatory issues. The Sustainability Team uses primarily issuer published documents such as its sustainability report website publicly available financial reports such as the issuer’s 10 K and the issuer’s proxy statement to prepare the Sustainability Team’s research. The Sustainability Team also undertakes an internet search for any litigation regulatory or reputational issues. The Sustainability Team may use third party research about industry trends for background information but it does not rely on third party data about the issuer for its assessment of the issuer. The Sustainability Team provides a sustainability assessment for all issuers held in the Fund’s portfolio. The Sustainability Team’s ratings are subjective. No industries are automatically excluded from consideration. The Adviser will vote all securities for which it has voting authority in the best interests of its clients. The Adviser’s Governance Committee votes all proxies. The Governance Committee assesses the likely effect of the proxy proposal on the value of the issuer’s stock including the effect on the management of the issuer the importance to shareholders of the proxy proposal and the cost of the proposal. The Sustainability Team also engages with issuers regarding sustainability deficiencies and reviews any improvements by issuers annually. The Fund generally invests in the equity securities of issuers believed by the Adviser to be undervalued in the marketplace focusing on issuers that combine attractive valuations with catalysts for change. The Adviser applies a bottom up stock selection process (i.e. one that focuses primarily on issuer specific factors) in managing the Fund using a combination of fundamental and quantitative analysis. In selecting investments for the Fund the Adviser considers various factors such as price to book value price to sales and earnings ratios dividend yields strength of management and cash flow to identify securities that are trading at a price that appears to be lower than the issuer s inherent value. The Adviser will sell a stock when it no longer meets one or more investment criteria either through obtaining target value or due to an adverse change in fundamentals business momentum or sustainability practices of a specific investment or industry. Each holding has a target valuation established at purchase which the Adviser constantly monitors and adjusts as appropriate. The Fund may (but is not required to) invest in derivatives including put and call options futures forward contracts and swaps in lieu of investing directly in a security currency or instrument for hedging and non hedging purposes. The Fund may invest up to 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments including investments that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale. The Fund may participate as a purchaser in initial public offerings of securities ( IPO ). An IPO is a company s first offering of stock to the public. The Fund may also seek to increase its income by lending portfolio securities. While the Adviser intends to fully invest the Fund s assets at all times in accordance with the above mentioned policies the Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and eligible U.S. dollar denominated money market instruments and make investments inconsistent with its investment objective. The Adviser will determine when market conditions warrant temporary defensive measures.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The Fund s principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to facilitate finding particular risks and comparing them with other funds. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. 28 •Convertible Securities Risk. Securities that can be converted into common stock such as certain securities and preferred stock are subject to the usual risks associated with fixed income investments such as interest rate risk and credit risk. In addition because they react to changes in the value of the equity securities into which they will convert convertible securities are also subject to the risks associated with equity securities. •Currency Risk. Investment in foreign securities also involves currency risk associated with securities that trade or are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and which may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. An increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a foreign currency may cause the U.S. dollar value of an investment in that country to decline. Foreign currencies also are subject to risks caused by inflation interest rates budget deficits and low savings rates political factors and government controls. •Cyber Security Risk. Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or its investment adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. •Derivatives Risk. The Fund s investments in derivative instruments which include futures and options on securities securities indices or currencies options on these futures forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate or currency swaps may be leveraged and result in losses exceeding the amounts invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. •Emerging Markets Risk. Investment in emerging market securities involves greater risk than that associated with investment in securities of issuers in developed foreign countries. These risks include volatile currency exchange rates periods of high inflation increased risk of default greater social economic and political uncertainty and instability less governmental supervision and regulation of securities markets weaker auditing and financial reporting standards lack of liquidity in the markets and the significantly smaller market capitalizations of emerging market issuers. The information available of an emerging market issuer may be less reliable than for comparable issuers in more developed capital markets. •Exchange Traded Fund Risk. ETFs are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the ask price quoted by a seller and the bid price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their net asset value (“NAV”). 29 •Equity Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in or have exposure to equity securities. Equity securities tend to be more volatile than other investment choices such as debt and money market instruments. The value of your investment may decrease in response to overall stock market movements or the value of individual securities. •Foreign Custody Risk. The Fund may hold foreign securities and cash with foreign banks agents and securities depositories appointed by the Fund’s custodian (each a “Foreign Custodian”). Some Foreign Custodians may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business. In some countries Foreign Custodians may be subject to little or no regulatory oversight over or independent evaluation of their operations. Further the laws of certain countries may place limitations on the Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a Foreign Custodian enters bankruptcy. Investments in emerging markets may be subject to even greater custody risks than investments in more developed markets. Custody services in emerging market countries are very often undeveloped and may be considerably less well regulated than in more developed countries and thus may not afford the same level of investor protection as would apply in developed countries. •Foreign Securities Risk. International investing may be subject to special risks including but not limited to currency exchange rate volatility political social or economic instability less publicly available information less stringent investor protections and differences in taxation auditing and other financial practices. The Fund may invest in securities of foreign issuers either directly or through depositary receipts. Depositary receipts may be available through sponsored or unsponsored facilities. Holders of unsponsored depositary receipts generally bear all of the costs of the unsponsored facility. The depository of an unsponsored facility is frequently under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the issuer of the deposited security or to pass through to the holders of the receipts voting rights with respect to the deposited securities. The depository of unsponsored depositary receipts may provide less information to receipt holders. Participatory notes ( P notes ) are derivative instruments used by investors to take positions in certain foreign securities. P notes present similar risks to investing directly in such securities and also expose investors to counterparty risk. Foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be traded in markets that close before the time that the Fund calculates its NAV. Furthermore certain foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not calculate its NAV. As a result the value of the Fund s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund s shares. •Illiquid Investments Risk. Investing in illiquid investments is subject to certain risks such as limitations on resale and uncertainty in determining valuation. Limitations on resale may adversely affect the marketability of portfolio securities and the Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid investments promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days. The Fund might in order to dispose of restricted securities have to register securities resulting in additional expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of such securities. Less liquid securities that the Fund may want to invest in may be difficult or impossible to purchase. Federal banking regulations may also cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of certain securities which may further decrease the Fund s ability to buy or sell such securities. •IPO Risk. IPO risk is the risk that the market value of IPO shares will fluctuate considerably due to certain factors such as the absence of a prior public market unseasoned trading the small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer. The purchase of IPO shares may involve high transaction costs. IPO shares are subject to market risk and liquidity risk. When the Fund s asset base is small a significant portion of the Fund s performance could be attributable to investments in IPOs because such investments would have a magnified impact on the Fund. As the Fund s assets grow the effect of the Fund s investments in IPOs on the Fund s performance probably will decline which could reduce the Fund s performance. Because of the price volatility of IPO shares the Fund may choose to hold IPO shares for a very short period of time. This may increase the turnover of the Fund s portfolio and may lead to increased expenses to the Fund such as commissions and transaction costs. In addition the Adviser cannot guarantee continued access to IPOs. •Large Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of large capitalization companies as a group could fall out of favor with the market causing the Fund to underperform investments that focus solely on small or medium capitalization stocks. •Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. In other words the individual stocks in the Fund may not perform as well as expected and or the Fund s portfolio management practices do not work to achieve their desired result. •Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the prices of these stocks will not move even lower. •Micro Cap Companies Risk. Micro cap stocks may be very sensitive to changing economic conditions and market downturns because the issuers often have narrow markets for their products or services fewer product lines and more limited managerial and financial resources than larger issuers. The stocks of micro cap companies may therefore be more volatile and the ability to sell them at a desirable time or price may be more limited. •Mid Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of mid sized companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than stocks of larger more established companies. •New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized diversified management investment company with a limited operating history. In addition there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size in which case the Board of the Company may determine to liquidate the Fund. •Options Risk. An option is a type of derivative instrument that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy (a call ) or sell (a put ) an asset in the near future at an agreed upon price prior to the expiration date of the option. The Fund may cover a call option by owning the security underlying the option or through other means. The value of options can be highly volatile and their use can result in loss if the Adviser is incorrect in its expectation of price fluctuations. •REITs Risk. REITs may be affected by economic forces and other factors related to the real estate industry. These risks include possible declines in the value of real estate possible lack of availability of mortgage funds and unexpected vacancies of properties. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers self liquidation interest rate risks (especially mortgage REITs) and liquidity risk. REITs that invest in real estate mortgages are also subject to prepayment risk. Investing in REITs may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies. REITs may have limited financial resources may trade less frequently and in a limited volume engage in dilutive offerings and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically small capitalization stocks such as REITs have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in the S P 500® Index. In addition REITs could possibly fail to (i) qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable tax law or (ii) maintain their exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended. 30 •Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend portfolio securities to institutions such as certain broker dealers. The Fund may experience a loss or delay in the recovery of its securities if the borrowing institution breaches its agreement with the Fund. •Small Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of smaller companies may be subject to more abrupt erratic market movements than stocks of larger more established companies. Small companies may have limited product lines or financial resources or may be dependent on a small or inexperienced management group and their securities may trade less frequently and in lower volume than securities of larger companies which could lead to higher transaction costs. Generally the smaller the company size the greater the risk. •Sustainable Investment Risk. The sustainability criterion required for Fund investment may cause the Fund to not invest in certain industries or issuers. As a result the Fund may be overweight or underweight in certain industries or issuers relative to its benchmark index which may cause the Fund’s performance to be more or less sensitive to developments affecting those industries or issuers. Sustainability information provided by issuers upon which the portfolio managers may rely continues to develop and may be incomplete inaccurate use different methodologies or be applied differently across companies and industries. Further the regulatory landscape for sustainable investing in the United States is still developing and future rules and regulations may require the Fund to modify or alter its investment process. Similarly government policies incentivizing issuers to engage in sustainable practices may fall out of favor which could potentially limit the Fund’s investment universe. There is also a risk that the companies identified through the investment process may fail to adhere to sustainable business practices which may result in the Fund selling a security when it might otherwise be disadvantageous to do so. There is no guarantee that sustainable investments will outperform the broader market on either an absolute or relative basis.'}, 5: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS GLOBAL EQUITY FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks to provide long term capital growth.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund pursues its objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in a non diversified portfolio of equity and equity related securities issued by U.S. and non U.S. companies of any capitalization size.

Securities are selected by the Adviser using its “three circles” approach which combines a quantitative screening with a fundamental bottom up selection process. This investment strategy is grounded in the following principles (1) low valuation stocks outperform high valuation stocks (2) companies with strong fundamentals e.g. high and sustainable returns on invested capital outperform companies with weak fundamentals and (3) stocks with positive business momentum e.g. rising earnings estimates outperform stocks with negative business momentum. The Adviser examines various factors in determining the value characteristics of issuers including price to book value ratios and price to earnings ratios. These value characteristics are examined in the context of the issuer’s operating and financial fundamentals such as return on equity and earnings growth and cash flow. The Fund intends under normal circumstances to invest at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in the securities of emerging market issuers related derivative instruments and other investments that are tied economically to emerging market countries. The Adviser considers an emerging market country to include any country that is 1) generally recognized to be an emerging market country by the international financial community including the World Bank 2) classified by the United Nations as a developing country or 3) included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Due to the unique relationship between China and its separately administered regions the Adviser includes Hong Kong and Macau as emerging markets independent of above definitions 1 through 3. The Adviser determines that an investment is tied economically to an emerging market if such investment satisfies one or more of the following conditions 1) the issuer’s primary trading market is in an emerging market 2) the issuer is organized under the laws of derives at least 50 of its revenue from or has at least 50 of its assets in emerging markets 3) the investment is included in an index representative of emerging markets and 4) the investment is exposed to the economic risks and returns of emerging markets. In managing the Fund’s portfolio the Adviser will seek to identify mispriced publicly traded equity securities of emerging market companies and purchase securities that the Adviser believes will outperform emphasizing low valuation positive business momentum and high quality. The Fund’s portfolio is rebalanced regularly to maintain the optimal risk return trade off. The Adviser assesses each stock’s changing characteristics relative to its contribution to portfolio risk. The Adviser will sell a stock that the Adviser believes no longer offers an appropriate return to risk tradeoff. The Fund’s investment adviser may engage in active trading and will not consider portfolio turnover a limiting factor in making decisions for the Fund. 42 The equity securities in which the Fund will invest which may include equity securities of non U.S. issuers that are traded in the markets of the United States include equity securities issued by large mid and small or micro cap companies as well as exchange traded and over the counter common and preferred stocks warrants options rights convertible securities sponsored and unsponsored depositary receipts and shares trust certificates limited partnership interests shares of other investment companies (including exchanged traded funds (“ETFs”)) real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and equity participations. An equity participation is a type of loan that gives the lender a portion of equity ownership in a property in addition to principal and interest payments. A convertible security is a bond debenture note preferred stock or other security that may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock of the same or a different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula. The Fund may invest in securities of companies operating for three years or less (“unseasoned issuers”). The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations (commonly known as “junk bonds”) such as bonds and debentures used by corporations and other business organizations (e.g. trusts or limited liability companies). Such high yield debt obligations are not considered to be investment grade. Junk bonds are rated BB or lower by S P Global or have a comparable rating by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization (or if unrated are determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality at the time of investment). The Fund may invest in securities of the lowest rating category including securities in default. The Adviser may but is not required to sell a bond or note held by the Fund in the event that its credit rating is downgraded. The Fund will primarily invest in fixed income instruments including high yield debt obligations when the Fund believes that such instruments offer a better risk reward profile than comparable equity opportunities. To meet margin requirements redemptions or pending investments the Fund may also temporarily hold a portion of its assets in full faith and credit obligations of the United States government and in short term notes commercial paper or other money market instruments. The Adviser will sell a stock when it no longer meets one or more investment criteria either through obtaining target value or due to an adverse change in fundamentals or business momentum. Each holding has a target valuation established at purchase which the Adviser constantly monitors and adjusts as appropriate. In general the Fund’s investments will be spread over a number of industries and as a matter of policy the Fund is limited to investing less than 25 of its total assets in any one industry except that the Fund may invest in exchange traded funds to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (“1940 Act”) and applicable SEC orders. The Fund may participate as a purchaser in initial public offerings of securities (“IPOs”). An IPO is a company’s first offering of stock to the public. The Fund may invest up to 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments including investments that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale. The Fund may also seek to increase its income by lending portfolio securities. The Fund will invest in derivatives including put and call options futures contracts for differences forward contracts and swaps in lieu of investing directly in a security currency or instrument for hedging and non hedging purposes. Contracts for differences offer exposure to price changes in an underlying security without ownership of such security typically by providing investors the ability to trade on margin. The Fund’s investments in derivative instruments may be leveraged and result in losses exceeding the amounts invested. While the Adviser intends to fully invest the Fund’s assets at all times in accordance with the above mentioned policies the Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and eligible U.S. dollar denominated money market instruments and make investments inconsistent with its investment objective. The Adviser will determine when market conditions warrant temporary defensive measures.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The Fund’s principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to facilitate finding particular risks and comparing them with other funds. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● Convertible Securities Risk. Securities that can be converted into common stock such as certain securities and preferred stock are subject to the usual risks associated with fixed income investments such as interest rate risk and credit risk. In addition because they react to changes in the value of the equity securities into which they will convert convertible securities are also subject to the risks associated with equity securities. ● Currency Risk. Investment in foreign securities also involves currency risk associated with securities that trade or are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and which may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. An increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a foreign currency may cause the U.S. dollar value of an investment in that country to decline. Foreign currencies also are subject to risks caused by inflation interest rates budget deficits and low savings rates political factors and government controls. ● Cyber Security Risk. Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or its investment adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivative instruments which include futures and options on securities securities indices or currencies options on these futures forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate or currency swaps may be leveraged and result in losses exceeding the amounts invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. ● Emerging Markets Risk. Investment in emerging market securities involves greater risk than that associated with investment in securities of issuers in developed foreign countries. These risks include volatile currency exchange rates periods of high inflation increased risk of default greater social economic and political uncertainty and instability less governmental supervision and regulation of securities markets weaker auditing and financial reporting standards lack of liquidity in the markets and the significantly smaller market capitalizations of emerging market issuers. The information available about an emerging market issuer may be less reliable than for comparable issuers in more developed capital markets. 44 ● Equity Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in or have exposure to equity securities. Equity securities tend to be more volatile than other investment choices such as debt and money market instruments. The value of your investment may decrease in response to overall stock market movements or the value of individual securities. ● Exchange Traded Fund Risk. Exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their net asset value (“NAV”). ● Foreign Custody Risk. The Fund may hold foreign securities and cash with foreign banks agents and securities depositories appointed by the Fund’s custodian (each a “Foreign Custodian”). Some Foreign Custodians may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business. In some countries Foreign Custodians may be subject to little or no regulatory oversight over or independent evaluation of their operations. Further the laws of certain countries may place limitations on the Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a Foreign Custodian enters bankruptcy. Investments in emerging markets may be subject to even greater custody risks than investments in more developed markets. Custody services in emerging market countries are very often undeveloped and may be considerably less well regulated than in more developed countries and thus may not afford the same level of investor protection as would apply in developed countries. ● Foreign Securities Risk. International investing may be subject to special risks including but not limited to currency exchange rate volatility political social or economic instability less publicly available information less stringent investor protections and differences in taxation auditing and other financial practices. Foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be traded in markets that close before the time that the Fund calculates its NAV. Furthermore certain foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not calculate its NAV. As a result the value of the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. ● High Yield Debt Obligations Risk. The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in Junk Bonds such as bonds and debentures issued by corporations and other business organizations. An issuer of debt obligations may default on its obligation to pay interest and repay principal. Also changes in the financial strength of an issuer or changes in the credit rating of a security may affect its value. Such Junk Bonds are not considered to be investment grade. ● Illiquid Investments Risk. Investing in illiquid investments is subject to certain risks such as limitations on resale and uncertainty in determining valuation. Limitations on resale may adversely affect the marketability of portfolio securities and the Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid investments promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days. The Fund might in order to dispose of restricted securities have to register securities resulting in additional expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of such securities. Less liquid securities that the Fund may want to invest in may be difficult or impossible to purchase. Federal banking regulations may also cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of certain securities which may further decrease the Fund’s ability to buy or sell such securities. 45 ● IPO Risk. IPO risk is the risk that the market value of IPO shares will fluctuate considerably due to certain factors such as the absence of a prior public market unseasoned trading the small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer. The purchase of IPO shares may involve high transaction costs. IPO shares are subject to market risk and liquidity risk. When the Fund’s asset base is small a significant portion of the Fund’s performance could be attributable to investments in IPOs because such investments would have a magnified impact on the Fund. As the Fund’s assets grow the effect of the Fund’s investments in IPOs on the Fund’s performance probably will decline which could reduce the Fund’s performance. Because of the price volatility of IPO shares the Fund may choose to hold IPO shares for a very short period of time. This may increase the turnover of the Fund’s portfolio and may lead to increased expenses to the Fund such as commissions and transaction costs. In addition the Adviser cannot guarantee continued access to IPOs. ● Large Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of large capitalization companies as a group could fall out of favor with the market causing the Fund to underperform investments that focus solely on small or medium capitalization stocks. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. In other words the individual stocks in the Fund makes may not perform as well as expected and or the Fund’s portfolio management practices may not work to achieve their desired result. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the long portfolio of the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the prices of these stocks will not move even lower. ● Mid Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of mid sized companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than stocks of larger more established companies. ● Micro Cap Companies Risk. Micro cap stocks may be very sensitive to changing economic conditions and market downturns because the issuers often have narrow markets for their products or services fewer product lines and more limited managerial and financial resources than larger issuers. The stocks of micro cap companies may therefore be more volatile and the ability to sell them at a desirable time or price may be more limited. ● Options Risk. An option is a type of derivative instrument that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy (a “call”) or sell (a “put”) an asset in the near future at an agreed upon price prior to the expiration date of the option. The Fund may “cover” a call option by owning the security underlying the option or through other means. The value of options can be highly volatile and their use can result in loss if the Adviser is incorrect in its expectation of price fluctuations. Losses incurred by the Fund in writing options can be potentially unlimited. ● Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may frequently trade its portfolio securities resulting in higher brokerage commissions and transaction costs which could lower the Fund’s performance. In addition to lower performance high portfolio turnover could result in taxable capital gains. A portfolio turnover rate of 100 is considered to be high. The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Fund is not expected to exceed 400 however it may be higher if the Adviser believes it will improve the Fund’s performance. 46 ● REITs Risk. REITs may be affected by economic forces and other factors related to the real estate industry. These risks include possible declines in the value of real estate possible lack of availability of mortgage funds and unexpected vacancies of properties. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers self liquidation interest rate risks (especially mortgage REITs) and liquidity risk. REITs that invest in real estate mortgages are also subject to prepayment risk. Investing in REITs may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies. REITs may have limited financial resources may trade less frequently and in a limited volume engage in dilutive offerings and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically small capitalization stocks such as REITs have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in the S P 500® Index. In addition REITs could possibly fail to (i) qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable tax law or (ii) maintain their exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act. ● Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend portfolio securities to institutions such as certain broker dealers. The Fund may experience a loss or delay in the recovery of its securities if the borrowing institution breaches its agreement with the Fund. ● Segregated Account Risk. The Fund’s transactions in derivative instruments may require the Fund to establish a segregated account consisting of cash or liquid securities in an amount sufficient to cover the transactions. A security held in a segregated account cannot be sold while the position it is covering is outstanding unless it is replaced with a similar security. As a result there is a possibility that segregation of a large percentage of the Fund’s assets could impede portfolio management or the Fund’s ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations. ● Small Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of smaller companies may be subject to more abrupt erratic market movements than stocks of larger more established companies. Small companies may have limited product lines or financial resources or may be dependent on a small or inexperienced management group and their securities may trade less frequently and in lower volume than securities of larger companies which could lead to higher transaction costs. Generally the smaller the company size the greater the risk. ● Unseasoned Issuers Risk. Unseasoned issuers may not have an established financial history and may have limited product lines markets or financial resources. Unseasoned issuers may depend on a few key personnel for management and may be susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy. As a result such securities may be more volatile and difficult to sell.'}, 7: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS LONG SHORT EQUITY FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks long term capital appreciation while reducing exposure to general equity market risk. The Fund seeks a total return greater than that of the S P 500® Index over a full market cycle.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund invests in long positions in stocks identified by the Adviser as undervalued and takes short positions in stocks that the Adviser has identified as overvalued. The cash proceeds from short sales will be invested in short term cash instruments to produce a return on such proceeds just below the federal funds rate. Short sales are considered speculative transactions and a form of leverage. The Fund invests both long and short in securities principally traded in the United States markets. The Fund may invest in securities of companies operating for three years or less (“unseasoned issuers”). The Adviser will determine the size of each long or short position by analyzing the tradeoff between the attractiveness of each position and its impact on the risk of the overall portfolio. The Fund seeks to construct a portfolio that has less volatility than the United States equity market generally. The Adviser examines various factors in determining the value characteristics of such issuers including price to book value ratios and price to earnings ratios. These value characteristics are examined in the context of the issuer’s operating and financial fundamentals such as return on equity earnings growth and cash flow. The Adviser selects securities for the Fund based on a continuous study of trends in industries and companies earnings power and growth and other investment criteria. The Fund intends under normal circumstances to invest at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities. Under normal circumstances the Adviser expects that the Fund’s long positions will not exceed approximately 125 of the Fund’s net assets. The Fund’s long and short positions may involve (without limit) equity securities of foreign issuers that are traded in the markets of the United States. The Fund may also invest up to 20 of its total assets directly in equity securities of foreign issuers. To meet margin requirements redemptions or pending investments the Fund may also temporarily hold a portion of its assets in full faith and credit obligations of the United States government and in short term notes commercial paper or other money market instruments.

The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations such as bonds and debentures issued by corporations and other business organizations. An issuer of debt obligations may default on its obligation to pay interest and repay principal. Also changes in the financial strength of an issuer or changes in the credit rating of a security may affect its value.

This may increase the turnover of the Fund’s portfolio and may lead to increased expenses to the Fund such as commissions and transaction costs. In addition the Adviser cannot guarantee continued access to IPOs. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. In other words the Adviser may not be successful in its strategy of taking long positions in stocks the manager believes to be undervalued and short positions in stocks the manager believes to be overvalued. Further since the Adviser will manage both a long and a short portfolio there is the risk that the Adviser may make more poor investment decisions than an adviser of a typical stock mutual fund with only a long portfolio may make. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the long portfolio of the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the prices of these stocks will not move even lower. ● Portfolio Turnover Risk.

As a result there is a possibility that segregation of a large percentage of the Fund’s assets could impede portfolio management or the Fund’s ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations. ● Short Sales Risk. Short sales of securities may result in gains if a security’s price declines but may result in losses if a security’s price rises. 53 ● Small Cap Companies Risk. The small capitalization equity securities in which the Fund may invest may be traded only in the over the counter market or on a regional securities exchange may be listed only in the quotation service commonly known as the “pink sheets ” and may not be traded every day or in the volume typical of trading on a national securities exchange. These securities may also be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The trading market for any given small capitalization equity security may be sufficiently small as to make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a substantial block of such securities. The sale by the Fund of portfolio securities to meet redemptions may require the Fund to sell its small capitalization securities at a discount from market prices or during periods when in the Adviser’s judgment such sale is not desirable. Moreover the lack of an efficient market for these securities may make them difficult to value. ● Unseasoned Issuers Risk. Unseasoned issuers may not have an established financial history and may have limited product lines markets or financial resources. Unseasoned issuers may depend on a few key personnel for management and may be susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy. As a result such securities may be more volatile and difficult to sell.'}, 8: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS LONG SHORT RESEARCH FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks to provide long term total return.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund uses a hedged strategy.

Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or its investment adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivative instruments which include futures and options on securities securities indices or currencies options on these futures forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate or currency swaps may be leveraged and result in losses exceeding the amounts invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. ● Exchange Traded Fund Risk. Exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their net asset value (“NAV”). 59 ● Foreign Custody Risk. The Fund may hold foreign securities and cash with foreign banks agents and securities depositories appointed by the Fund’s custodian (each a “Foreign Custodian”). Some Foreign Custodians may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business. In some countries Foreign Custodians may be subject to little or no regulatory oversight over or independent evaluation of their operations. Further the laws of certain countries may place limitations on the Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a Foreign Custodian enters bankruptcy. Investments in emerging markets may be subject to even greater custody risks than investments in more developed markets. Custody services in emerging market countries are very often undeveloped and may be considerably less well regulated than in more developed countries and thus may not afford the same level of investor protection as would apply in developed countries. ● Foreign Securities Risk. International investing may be subject to special risks including currency exchange rate volatility political social or economic instability less publicly available information less stringent investor protections and differences in taxation auditing and financial practices. Foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be traded in markets that close before the time that the Fund calculates its NAV. Furthermore certain foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not calculate its NAV. As a result the value of the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. ● High Yield Debt Obligations Risk. The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations (of any rating including defaulted securities and unrated securities) including bonds and debentures issued by corporations and business organizations. An issuer of debt obligations may default on its obligation to pay interest and repay principal. Also changes in the financial strength of an issuer or changes in the credit rating of a security may affect its value. Such high yield debt obligations are referred to as “junk bonds” and are not considered to be investment grade. ● Illiquid Investments Risk. Investing in illiquid investments is subject to certain risks such as limitations on resale and uncertainty in determining valuation. Limitations on resale may adversely affect the marketability of portfolio securities and the Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid investments promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days. Less liquid securities that the Fund may want to invest in may be difficult or impossible to purchase. Federal banking regulations may also cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of certain securities which may further decrease the Fund’s ability to buy or sell such securities. ● Indexed Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in indexed securities whose value is linked to securities indices. Most such securities have values that rise and fall according to the change in one or more specified indices and may have characteristics similar to direct investments in the underlying securities. Depending on the index such securities may have greater volatility than the market as a whole. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. The Adviser may be incorrect in the stocks it buys and believes to be undervalued and in stocks it sells short and believes to be overvalued. Further since the Adviser will manage both a long and a short portfolio there is the risk that the Adviser may make more poor investment decisions than an adviser of a typical stock mutual fund with only a long portfolio. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the long portfolio of the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the price of these stocks will not move even lower. 60 ● Portfolio Turnover Risk. If the Fund frequently trades its portfolio securities the Fund will incur higher brokerage commissions and transaction costs which could lower the Fund’s performance. In addition to lower performance high portfolio turnover could result in taxable capital gains. A portfolio turnover rate of 100 is considered to be high. The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Fund is not expected to exceed 300 however it may be higher if the Adviser believes it will improve the Fund’s performance. ● REITs Risk. REITs may be affected by economic forces and other factors related to the real estate industry. These risks include possible declines in the value of real estate possible lack of availability of mortgage funds and unexpected vacancies of properties. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers self liquidation interest rate risks (especially mortgage REITs) and liquidity risk. REITs that invest in real estate mortgages are also subject to prepayment risk. Investing in REITs may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies. REITs may have limited financial resources may trade less frequently and in a limited volume engage in dilutive offerings and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically small capitalization stocks such as REITs have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in the S P 500® Index. In addition REITs could possibly fail to (i) qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable tax law or (ii) maintain their exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act. ● Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend portfolio securities to institutions such as certain broker dealers. The Fund may experience a loss or delay in the recovery of its securities if the borrowing institution breaches its agreement with the Fund. ● Short Sales Risk. Short sales of securities may result in gains if a security’s price declines but may result in losses if a security’s price rises. In a rising market short positions may be more likely to result in losses because securities sold short may be more likely to increase in value. Short selling also involves the risks of increased leverage and its accompanying potential for losses the potential inability to reacquire a security in a timely manner or at an acceptable price the possibility of the lender terminating the loan at any time forcing the Fund to close the transaction under unfavorable circumstances the additional costs that may be incurred and the potential loss of investment flexibility caused by the Fund’s obligations to provide collateral to the lender and set aside assets to cover the open position. Short sales “against the box” may protect the Fund against the risk of losses in the value of a portfolio security because any decline in value of the security should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding gain in the short position. Any potential gains in the security however would be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding loss in the short position. Short sales that are not “against the box” involve a form of investment leverage and the amount of the Fund’s loss on a short sale is potentially unlimited. ● Small Cap Companies Risk. The small capitalization equity securities in which the Fund may invest may be traded only in the over the counter market or on a regional securities exchange may be listed only in the quotation service commonly known as the “pink sheets ” and may not be traded every day or in the volume typical of trading on a national securities exchange. These securities may also be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The trading market for any given small capitalization equity security may be sufficiently small as to make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a substantial block of such securities. The sale by the Fund of portfolio securities to meet redemptions may require the Fund to sell its small capitalization securities at a discount from market prices or during periods when in the Adviser’s judgment such sale is not desirable. Moreover the lack of an efficient market for these securities may make them difficult to value. ● Unseasoned Issuers Risk. Unseasoned issuers may not have an established financial history and may have limited product lines markets or financial resources. Unseasoned issuers may depend on a few key personnel for management and may be susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy. As a result such securities may be more volatile and difficult to sell.'}, 9: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS GLOBAL LONG SHORT FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks long term growth of capital.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund invests in long positions in stocks identified by the Adviser as undervalued and takes short positions in stocks that the Adviser has identified as overvalued. The cash proceeds from short sales will be invested in short term cash instruments to produce a return on such proceeds just below the federal funds rate. Short sales are considered speculative transactions and a form of leverage. The Fund invests both long and short in securities issued by U.S. and non U.S. companies of any capitalization size. 65 With a long position the Fund purchases a stock outright with a short position the Fund sells a security that it does not own and must borrow to meet its settlement obligations. The Fund may invest in securities of companies operating for three years or less (“unseasoned issuers”). The Adviser will determine the size of each long or short position by analyzing the tradeoff between the attractiveness of each position and its impact on the risk of the overall portfolio. The Adviser examines various factors in determining the value characteristics of such issuers including price to book value ratios and price to earnings ratios. These value characteristics are examined in the context of the issuer’s operating and financial fundamentals including return on equity earnings growth and cash flow. The Adviser selects securities for the Fund based on a continuous study of trends in industries and companies earnings power and growth and other investment criteria. The Fund may invest in all types of equity and equity related securities including without limitation exchange traded and over the counter common and preferred stocks warrants options rights convertible securities sponsored and unsponsored depositary receipts and shares trust certificates limited partnership interests shares of other investment companies (including exchanged traded funds (“ETFs”)) real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and equity participation. An equity participation is a type of loan that gives the lender a portion of equity ownership in a property in addition to principal and interest payments. A convertible security is a bond debenture note preferred stock or other security that may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock of the same or a different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula. The Fund defines non U.S. companies as companies (i) that are organized under the laws of a foreign country (ii) whose principal trading market is in a foreign country or (iii) that have a majority of their assets or that derive a significant portion of their revenue or profits from businesses investments or sales outside of the United States. Under normal market conditions the Fund invests significantly (ordinarily at least 40 — unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the Adviser in which case the Fund would invest at least 30 ) in non U.S. companies. The Fund principally will be invested in issuers located in countries with developed securities markets but may also invest in issuers located in emerging markets. The Fund will allocate its assets among various regions and countries including the United States (but in no less than three different countries). The Fund’s portfolio is rebalanced regularly. The Adviser assesses each investment’s changing characteristics relative to its contribution to portfolio risk. The Adviser will sell an investment held long or close out a short position that the Adviser believes no longer offers an appropriate return to risk tradeoff. Under normal circumstances the Adviser expects to sell securities short so that the Fund’s portfolio is approximately 50 net long with an average of between 30 and 70 net long. To meet margin requirements redemptions or pending investments the Fund may also temporarily hold a portion of its assets in full faith and credit obligations of the United States government and in short term notes commercial paper or other money market instruments. The Adviser will sell a stock when it no longer meets one or more investment criteria either through obtaining target value or due to an adverse change in fundamentals or business momentum. Each holding has a target valuation established at purchase which the Adviser constantly monitors and adjusts as appropriate. The Fund may participate as a purchaser in initial public offerings of securities (“IPO”). An IPO is a company’s first offering of stock to the public. The Fund may invest from time to time a significant portion of its assets in smaller issuers which are more volatile and less liquid than investments in issuers with larger market capitalizations. The Fund may invest up to 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments including investments that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale. In general the Fund’s investments are broadly diversified over a number of industries and as a matter of policy the Fund is limited to investing a maximum of 25 of its total assets in any one industry. The Fund is non diversified and may invest in fewer securities at any one time than a diversified fund. 66 The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations such as bonds and debentures used by U.S. and foreign corporations and other business organizations (e.g. trusts or limited liability companies). Such high yield debt obligations are not considered to be investment grade. Non investment grade fixed income securities (commonly known as “junk bonds”) are rated BB or lower by S P Global or have a comparable rating by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization (or if unrated are determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality at the time of investment). The Fund may invest in securities of the lowest rating category including securities in default. The Adviser may but is not required to sell a bond or note held by the Fund in the event that its credit rating is downgraded. The Fund may (but is not required to) invest in derivatives including put and call options futures forward contracts and swaps in lieu of investing directly in a security currency or instrument for hedging and non hedging purposes. While the Adviser intends to fully invest the Fund’s assets at all times in accordance with the above mentioned policies the Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and eligible U.S. dollar denominated money market instruments and make investments inconsistent with its investment objective. The Adviser will determine when market conditions warrant temporary defensive measures.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The Fund’s principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to facilitate finding particular risks and comparing them with other funds. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● Convertible Securities Risk. Securities that can be converted into common stock such as certain securities and preferred stock are subject to the usual risks associated with fixed income investments such as interest rate risk and credit risk. In addition because they react to changes in the value of the equity securities into which they will convert convertible securities are also subject to the risks associated with equity securities. ● Currency Risk. Investment in foreign securities also involves currency risk associated with securities that trade or are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and which may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. An increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a foreign currency may cause the U.S. dollar value of an investment in that country to decline. Foreign currencies also are subject to risks caused by inflation interest rates budget deficits and low savings rates political factors and government controls. ● Cyber Security Risk. Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or its investment adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. 67 ● Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivative instruments which include futures and options on securities securities indices or currencies options on these futures forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate or currency swaps may be leveraged and result in losses exceeding the amounts invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. ● Emerging Markets Risk. Investment in emerging market securities involves greater risk than that associated with investment in securities of issuers in developed foreign countries. These risks include volatile currency exchange rates periods of high inflation increased risk of default greater social economic and political uncertainty and instability less governmental supervision and regulation of securities markets weaker auditing and financial reporting standards lack of liquidity in the markets and the significantly smaller market capitalizations of emerging market issuers. The information available about an emerging market issuer may be less reliable than for comparable issuers in more developed capital markets. ● Exchange Traded Fund Risk. Exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their net asset value (“NAV”). ● Foreign Custody Risk. The Fund may hold foreign securities and cash with foreign banks agents and securities depositories appointed by the Fund’s custodian (each a “Foreign Custodian”). Some Foreign Custodians may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business. In some countries Foreign Custodians may be subject to little or no regulatory oversight over or independent evaluation of their operations. Further the laws of certain countries may place limitations on the Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a Foreign Custodian enters bankruptcy. Investments in emerging markets may be subject to even greater custody risks than investments in more developed markets. Custody services in emerging market countries are very often undeveloped and may be considerably less well regulated than in more developed countries and thus may not afford the same level of investor protection as would apply in developed countries. 68 ● Foreign Securities Risk. International investing may be subject to special risks including but not limited to currency exchange rate volatility political social or economic instability less publicly available information less stringent investor protections and differences in taxation auditing and other financial practices. The Fund may invest in securities of foreign issuers either directly or through depositary receipts. Depositary receipts may be available through “sponsored” or “unsponsored” facilities. Holders of unsponsored depositary receipts generally bear all of the costs of the unsponsored facility. The depository of an unsponsored facility is frequently under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the issuer of the deposited security or to pass through to the holders of the receipts voting rights with respect to the deposited securities. The depository of unsponsored depositary receipts may provide less information to receipt holders. Participatory notes (“P notes”) are derivative instruments used by investors to take positions in certain foreign securities. P notes present similar risks to investing directly in such securities and also expose investors to counterparty risk. Foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be traded in markets that close before the time that the Fund calculates its NAV. Furthermore certain foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not calculate its NAV. As a result the value of the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. ● High Yield Debt Obligations Risk. The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations such as bonds and debentures issued by corporations and other business organizations. An issuer of debt obligations may default on its obligation to pay interest and repay principal. Also changes in the financial strength of an issuer or changes in the credit rating of a security may affect its value. Such high yield debt obligations are referred to as “junk bonds” and are not considered to be investment grade. ● Illiquid Investments Risk. Investing in illiquid investments is subject to certain risks such as limitations on resale and uncertainty in determining valuation. Limitations on resale may adversely affect the marketability of portfolio securities and the Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid investments promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days. The Fund might in order to dispose of restricted securities have to register securities resulting in additional expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of such securities. Less liquid securities that the Fund may want to invest in may be difficult or impossible to purchase. Federal banking regulations may also cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of certain securities which may further decrease the Fund’s ability to buy or sell such securities. ● IPO Risk. IPO risk is the risk that the market value of IPO shares will fluctuate considerably due to certain factors such as the absence of a prior public market unseasoned trading the small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer. The purchase of IPO shares may involve high transaction costs. IPO shares are subject to market risk and liquidity risk. When the Fund’s asset base is small a significant portion of the Fund’s performance could be attributable to investments in IPOs because such investments would have a magnified impact on the Fund. As the Fund’s assets grow the effect of the Fund’s investments in IPOs on the Fund’s performance probably will decline which could reduce the Fund’s performance. Because of the price volatility of IPO shares the Fund may choose to hold IPO shares for a very short period of time. This may increase the turnover of the Fund’s portfolio and may lead to increased expenses to the Fund such as commissions and transaction costs. In addition the Adviser cannot guarantee continued access to IPOs. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. In other words the Adviser may not be successful in its strategy of taking long positions in stocks the manager believes to be undervalued and short positions in stocks the manager believes to be overvalued. Further since the Adviser will manage both a long and a short portfolio there is the risk that the Adviser may make more poor investment decisions than an adviser of a typical stock mutual fund with only a long portfolio may make. 69 ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the long portfolio of the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the prices of these stocks will not move even lower. ● Non Diversification Risk. The Fund is non diversified. Compared to other funds the Fund may invest more of its assets in a smaller number of companies. Gains or losses on a single stock may have greater impact on the Fund. ● Options Risk. An option is a type of derivative instrument that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy (a “call”) or sell (a “put”) an asset in the near future at an agreed upon price prior to the expiration date of the option. The Fund may “cover” a call option by owning the security underlying the option or through other means. The value of options can be highly volatile and their use can result in loss if the Adviser is incorrect in its expectation of price fluctuations. Losses incurred by the Fund in writing options can be potentially unlimited. ● Portfolio Turnover Risk. If the Fund frequently trades its portfolio securities the Fund will incur higher brokerage commissions and transaction costs which could lower the Fund’s performance. In addition to lower performance high portfolio turnover could result in taxable capital gains. A portfolio turnover rate of 100 is considered to be high. The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Fund is not expected to exceed 400 however it may be higher if the Adviser believes it will improve the Fund’s performance. ● REITs Risk. REITs may be affected by economic forces and other factors related to the real estate industry. These risks include possible declines in the value of real estate possible lack of availability of mortgage funds and unexpected vacancies of properties. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers self liquidation interest rate risks (especially mortgage REITs) and liquidity risk. REITs that invest in real estate mortgages are also subject to prepayment risk. Investing in REITs may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies. REITs may have limited financial resources may trade less frequently and in a limited volume engage in dilutive offerings and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically small capitalization stocks such as REITs have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in the S P 500® Index. In addition REITs could possibly fail to (i) qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable tax law or (ii) maintain their exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act. ● Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend portfolio securities to institutions such as certain broker dealers. The Fund may experience a loss or delay in the recovery of its securities if the borrowing institution breaches its agreement with the Fund. ● Segregated Account Risk. A security held in a segregated account cannot be sold while the position it is covering is outstanding unless it is replaced with a similar security. As a result there is a possibility that segregation of a large percentage of the Fund’s assets could impede portfolio management or the Fund’s ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations. 70 ● Short Sales Risk. Short sales of securities may result in gains if a security’s price declines but may result in losses if a security’s price rises. In a rising market short positions may be more likely to result in losses because securities sold short may be more likely to increase in value. Short selling also involves the risks of increased leverage and its accompanying potential for losses the potential inability to reacquire a security in a timely manner or at an acceptable price the possibility of the lender terminating the loan at any time forcing the Fund to close the transaction under unfavorable circumstances the additional costs that may be incurred and the potential loss of investment flexibility caused by the Fund’s obligations to provide collateral to the lender and set aside assets to cover the open position. Short sales “against the box” may protect the Fund against the risk of losses in the value of a portfolio security because any decline in value of the security should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding gain in the short position. Any potential gains in the security however would be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding loss in the short position. Short sales that are not “against the box” involve a form of investment leverage and the amount of the Fund’s loss on a short sale is potentially unlimited. The use of short sales may cause the Fund to have higher expenses than those of other equity mutual funds because of higher transaction costs premiums interest or dividends payable to the lender. ● Small Cap Companies Risk. The small capitalization equity securities in which the Fund may invest may be traded only in the over the counter market or on a regional securities exchange may be listed only in the quotation service commonly known as the “pink sheets ” and may not be traded every day or in the volume typical of trading on a national securities exchange. These securities may also be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The trading market for any given small capitalization equity security may be sufficiently small as to make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a substantial block of such securities. The sale by the Fund of portfolio securities to meet redemptions may require the Fund to sell its small capitalization securities at a discount from market prices or during periods when in the Adviser’s judgment such sale is not desirable. Moreover the lack of an efficient market for these securities may make them difficult to value. ● Unseasoned Issuers Risk. Unseasoned issuers may not have an established financial history and may have limited product lines markets or financial resources. Unseasoned issuers may depend on a few key personnel for management and may be susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy. As a result such securities may be more volatile and difficult to sell.'}, 10: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS EMERGING MARKETS DYNAMIC EQUITY FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks long term growth of capital.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund will pursue its objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in equity and equity related securities. The Fund will invest in a non diversified multi strategy long short portfolio of equity securities and financial investments with equity like characteristics designed to provide exposure to emerging markets. Securities are selected by the Adviser using its “three circles” approach which combines a quantitative screening with a fundamental bottom up selection process. This investment strategy is grounded in the following principles (1) low valuation stocks outperform high valuation stocks (2) companies with strong fundamentals e.g. high and sustainable returns on invested capital outperform companies with weak fundamentals and (3) stocks with positive business momentum e.g. rising earnings estimates outperform stocks with negative business momentum. With a long position the Fund purchases a stock outright with a short position the Fund sells a security that it does not own and must borrow to meet its settlement obligations. The Adviser examines various factors in determining the value characteristics of issuers including price to book value ratios and price to earnings ratios. These value characteristics are examined in the context of the issuer’s operating and financial fundamentals such as return on equity and earnings growth and cash flow. The Fund intends under normal circumstances to invest at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in the securities of emerging market issuers related derivative instruments and other investments that are tied economically to emerging market countries. The Adviser considers an emerging market country to include any country that is 1) generally recognized to be an emerging market country by the international financial community including the World Bank 2) classified by the United Nations as a developing country or 3) included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Due to the unique relationship between China and its separately administered regions the Adviser includes Hong Kong and Macau as emerging markets independent of above definitions 1 through 3. The Adviser determines that an investment is tied economically to an emerging market if such investment satisfies one or more of the following conditions 1) the issuer’s primary trading market is in an emerging market 2) the issuer is organized under the laws of derives at least 50 of its revenue from or has at least 50 of its assets in emerging markets 3) the investment is included in an index representative of emerging markets and 4) the investment is exposed to the economic risks and returns of emerging markets. In managing the Fund’s portfolio the Adviser will seek to identify mispriced publicly traded equity securities of emerging market companies including shorting securities that the Adviser believes will underperform and purchasing securities that the Adviser believes will outperform. 75 The long portion of the portfolio will emphasize low valuation positive business momentum and high quality securities. The short portfolio will emphasize securities with high valuation risk high balance sheet risk and signs of slowing sales and earnings momentum. The Fund’s portfolio is rebalanced regularly to maintain the optimal risk return trade off. The Adviser assesses each stock’s changing characteristics relative to its contribution to portfolio risk. The Adviser will sell a stock held long or close out a short position in a stock that the Adviser believes no longer offers an appropriate return to risk tradeoff. The equity securities in which the Fund will invest include equity securities issued by large mid and small or micro cap companies as well as exchange traded and over the counter common and preferred stocks warrants options rights convertible securities sponsored and unsponsored depositary receipts and shares trust certificates limited partnership interests shares of other investment companies (including exchanged traded funds (“ETFs”)) real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and equity participations. An equity participation is a type of loan that gives the lender a portion of equity ownership in a property in addition to principal and interest payments. A convertible security is a bond debenture note preferred stock or other security that may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock of the same or a different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula. The Fund may invest in securities of companies operating for three years or less (“unseasoned issuers”). The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations such as bonds and debentures used by corporations and other business organizations (e.g. trusts or limited liability companies). Such high yield debt obligations are not considered to be investment grade. Non investment grade fixed income securities (commonly known as “junk bonds”) are rated BB or lower by S P Global or have a comparable rating by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization (or if unrated are determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality at the time of investment). The Fund may invest in securities of the lowest rating category including securities in default. The Adviser may but is not required to sell a bond or note held by the Fund in the event that its credit rating is downgraded. The Fund will primarily invest in fixed income instruments including high yield fixed income obligations when the Fund believes that such instruments offer a better risk reward profile than comparable equity opportunities. Under normal circumstances the Adviser expects that the Fund’s long positions will not exceed approximately 50 of the Fund’s net assets with a typical range of 30 to 70 net long. The Fund’s long and short positions may involve (without limit) equity securities of non U.S. issuers that are traded in the markets of the United States. In addition to the short sales discussed above the Fund may make short sales “against the box ” a transaction in which the Fund enters into a short sale of a security which the Fund owns. The proceeds of the short sale will be held by a broker until the settlement date at which time the Fund delivers the security to close the short position. The Fund receives the net proceeds from the short sale. It is currently expected that the majority of the Fund’s short sales will not be against the box. To meet margin requirements redemptions or pending investments the Fund may also temporarily hold a portion of its assets in full faith and credit obligations of the United States government and in short term notes commercial paper or other money market instruments. The Fund is the sole shareholder of Boston Partners Emerging Markets Long Short Offshore Ltd. a wholly owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the “Subsidiary”). Generally the Subsidiary invests primarily in futures contracts traded on Indian stock exchanges. The Fund and its Subsidiary comply with the same fundamental investment restrictions on an aggregate basis to the extent those restrictions are applicable to the investment activities of the Subsidiary. The Fund is the sole shareholder of its Subsidiary and does not expect shares of its Subsidiary to be offered or sold to other investors. An election has been made to cause the Subsidiary to be a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes accordingly the assets and income of the Subsidiary will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes no differently from the other assets and income of the Fund. 76 The Adviser will sell a stock when it no longer meets one or more investment criteria either through obtaining target value or due to an adverse change in fundamentals or business momentum. Each holding has a target valuation established at purchase which the Adviser constantly monitors and adjusts as appropriate. In general the Fund’s investments will be spread over a number of industries and as a matter of policy the Fund is limited to investing less than 25 of its total assets in any one industry except that the Fund may invest in exchange traded funds to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (“1940 Act”) and applicable SEC orders. The Fund may participate as a purchaser in initial public offerings of securities (“IPOs”). An IPO is a company’s first offering of stock to the public. The Fund may invest up to 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments including investments that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale. The Fund may also seek to increase its income by lending portfolio securities. The Fund will invest in derivatives including put and call options futures contracts for differences forward contracts and swaps in lieu of investing directly in a security currency or instrument for hedging and non hedging purposes. Contracts for differences offer exposure to price changes in an underlying security without ownership of such security typically by providing investors the ability to trade on margin. The Fund’s investments in derivative instruments may be leveraged and result in losses exceeding the amounts invested. While the Adviser intends to fully invest the Fund’s assets at all times in accordance with the above mentioned policies the Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and eligible U.S. dollar denominated money market instruments and make investments inconsistent with its investment objective. The Adviser will determine when market conditions warrant temporary defensive measures.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The Fund’s principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to facilitate finding particular risks and comparing them with other funds. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● Convertible Securities Risk. Securities that can be converted into common stock such as certain securities and preferred stock are subject to the usual risks associated with fixed income investments such as interest rate risk and credit risk. In addition because they react to changes in the value of the equity securities into which they will convert convertible securities are also subject to the risks associated with equity securities. ● Currency Risk. Investment in foreign securities also involves currency risk associated with securities that trade or are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and which may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. An increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a foreign currency may cause the U.S. dollar value of an investment in that country to decline. Foreign currencies also are subject to risks caused by inflation interest rates budget deficits and low savings rates political factors and government controls. 77 ● Cyber Security Risk. Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or its investment adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivative instruments which include futures and options on securities securities indices or currencies options on these futures forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate or currency swaps may be leveraged and result in losses exceeding the amounts invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. ● Emerging Markets Risk. Investment in emerging market securities involves greater risk than that associated with investment in securities of issuers in developed foreign countries. These risks include volatile currency exchange rates periods of high inflation increased risk of default greater social economic and political uncertainty and instability less governmental supervision and regulation of securities markets weaker auditing and financial reporting standards lack of liquidity in the markets and the significantly smaller market capitalizations of emerging market issuers. The information available about an emerging market issuer may be less reliable than for comparable issuers in more developed capital markets. ● Exchange Traded Fund Risk. Exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their net asset value (“NAV”). ● Foreign Custody Risk. The Fund may hold foreign securities and cash with foreign banks agents and securities depositories appointed by the Fund’s custodian (each a “Foreign Custodian”). Some Foreign Custodians may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business. In some countries Foreign Custodians may be subject to little or no regulatory oversight over or independent evaluation of their operations. Further the laws of certain countries may place limitations on the Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a Foreign Custodian enters bankruptcy. Investments in emerging markets may be subject to even greater custody risks than investments in more developed markets. Custody services in emerging market countries are very often undeveloped and may be considerably less well regulated than in more developed countries and thus may not afford the same level of investor protection as would apply in developed countries. 78 ● Foreign Securities Risk. International investing may be subject to special risks including but not limited to currency exchange rate volatility political social or economic instability less publicly available information less stringent investor protections and differences in taxation auditing and other financial practices. Foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be traded in markets that close before the time that the Fund calculates its NAV. Furthermore certain foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not calculate its NAV. As a result the value of the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. ● High Yield Debt Obligations Risk. The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations such as bonds and debentures issued by corporations and other business organizations. An issuer of debt obligations may default on its obligation to pay interest and repay principal. Also changes in the financial strength of an issuer or changes in the credit rating of a security may affect its value. Such high yield debt obligations are referred to as “junk bonds” and are not considered to be investment grade. ● Illiquid Investments Risk. Investing in illiquid investments is subject to certain risks such as limitations on resale and uncertainty in determining valuation. Limitations on resale may adversely affect the marketability of portfolio securities and the Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid investments promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days. The Fund might in order to dispose of restricted securities have to register securities resulting in additional expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of such securities. Less liquid securities that the Fund may want to invest in may be difficult or impossible to purchase. Federal banking regulations may also cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of certain securities which may further decrease the Fund’s ability to buy or sell such securities. ● IPO Risk. IPO risk is the risk that the market value of IPO shares will fluctuate considerably due to certain factors such as the absence of a prior public market unseasoned trading the small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer. The purchase of IPO shares may involve high transaction costs. IPO shares are subject to market risk and liquidity risk. When the Fund’s asset base is small a significant portion of the Fund’s performance could be attributable to investments in IPOs because such investments would have a magnified impact on the Fund. As the Fund’s assets grow the effect of the Fund’s investments in IPOs on the Fund’s performance probably will decline which could reduce the Fund’s performance. Because of the price volatility of IPO shares the Fund may choose to hold IPO shares for a very short period of time. This may increase the turnover of the Fund’s portfolio and may lead to increased expenses to the Fund such as commissions and transaction costs. In addition the Adviser cannot guarantee continued access to IPOs. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. The Adviser may not be successful in its strategy of taking long positions in securities the Adviser believes to be undervalued and short positions in securities the Adviser believes to be overvalued. Further since the Adviser will manage both a long and a short portfolio there is the risk that the Adviser may make more poor investment decisions than an adviser of a typical stock mutual fund with only a long portfolio may make. Investments the Fund makes may not perform as well as expected and or the Fund’s portfolio management practices may not work to achieve their desired result. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the long portfolio of the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the prices of these stocks will not move even lower. 79 ● Micro Cap Companies Risk. Micro cap stocks may be very sensitive to changing economic conditions and market downturns because the issuers often have narrow markets for their products or services fewer product lines and more limited managerial and financial resources than larger issuers. The stocks of micro cap companies may therefore be more volatile and the ability to sell them at a desirable time or price may be more limited. ● Mid Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of mid sized companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than stocks of larger more established companies. ● Non Diversification Risk. The Fund is non diversified. Compared to other funds the Fund may invest more of its assets in a smaller number of companies. Gains or losses on a single stock may have greater impact on the Fund. ● Options Risk. An option is a type of derivative instrument that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy (a “call”) or sell (a “put”) an asset in the near future at an agreed upon price prior to the expiration date of the option. The Fund may “cover” a call option by owning the security underlying the option or through other means. The value of options can be highly volatile and their use can result in loss if the Adviser is incorrect in its expectation of price fluctuations. Losses incurred by the Fund in writing options can be potentially unlimited. ● Portfolio Turnover Risk. If the Fund frequently trades its portfolio securities the Fund will incur higher brokerage commissions and transaction costs which could lower the Fund’s performance. In addition to lower performance high portfolio turnover could result in taxable capital gains. A portfolio turnover rate of 100 is considered to be high. The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Fund is not expected to exceed 400 however it may be higher if the Adviser believes it will improve the Fund’s performance. ● REITs Risk. REITs may be affected by economic forces and other factors related to the real estate industry. These risks include possible declines in the value of real estate possible lack of availability of mortgage funds and unexpected vacancies of properties. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers self liquidation interest rate risks (especially mortgage REITs) and liquidity risk. REITs that invest in real estate mortgages are also subject to prepayment risk. Investing in REITs may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies. REITs may have limited financial resources may trade less frequently and in a limited volume engage in dilutive offerings and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically small capitalization stocks such as REITs have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in the S P 500® Index. In addition REITs could possibly fail to (i) qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable tax law or (ii) maintain their exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act. ● Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend portfolio securities to institutions such as certain broker dealers. The Fund may experience a loss or delay in the recovery of its securities if the borrowing institution breaches its agreement with the Fund. ● Segregated Account Risk. A security held in a segregated account cannot be sold while the position it is covering is outstanding unless it is replaced with a similar security. As a result there is a possibility that segregation of a large percentage of the Fund’s assets could impede portfolio management or the Fund’s ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations. 80 ● Short Sales Risk. Short sales of securities may result in gains if a security’s price declines but may result in losses if a security’s price rises. In a rising market short positions may be more likely to result in losses because securities sold short may be more likely to increase in value. Short selling is speculative and also involves the risks of increased leverage and its accompanying potential for losses the potential inability to reacquire a security in a timely manner or at an acceptable price the possibility of the lender terminating the loan at any time forcing the Fund to close the transaction under unfavorable circumstances the additional costs that may be incurred and the potential loss of investment flexibility caused by the Fund’s obligations to provide collateral to the lender and set aside assets to cover the open position. Short sales “against the box” may protect the Fund against the risk of losses in the value of a portfolio security because any decline in the value of the security should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding gain in the short position. Any potential gains in the security however would be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding loss in the short position. Short sales that are not “against the box” involve a form of investment leverage and the amount of the Fund’s loss on a short sale is potentially unlimited. The use of short sales may cause the Fund to have higher expenses than those of other equity mutual funds because of higher transaction costs premiums interest or dividends payable to the lender. ● Small Cap Companies Risk. The stocks of smaller companies may be subject to more abrupt erratic market movements than stocks of larger more established companies. Small companies may have limited product lines or financial resources or may be dependent on a small or inexperienced management group and their securities may trade less frequently and in lower volume than securities of larger companies which could lead to higher transaction costs. Generally the smaller the company size the greater the risk. ● Subsidiary Risks. By investing in the Subsidiary the Fund is indirectly exposed to the risks associated with the Subsidiary’s investments. The derivatives and other investments held by the Subsidiary are generally similar to those that are permitted to be held by the Fund and are subject to the same risks that apply to similar investments if held directly by the Fund. The Subsidiary is not registered under the 1940 Act and unless otherwise noted in this Prospectus is not subject to all the investor protections of the 1940 Act. Changes in the laws of the United States and or the Cayman Islands could result in the inability of the Fund and or the Subsidiary to continue to operate as it does currently and could adversely affect the Fund. ● Unseasoned Issuers Risk. Unseasoned issuers may not have an established financial history and may have limited product lines markets or financial resources. Unseasoned issuers may depend on a few key personnel for management and may be susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy. As a result such securities may be more volatile and difficult to sell.'}, 11: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS ALL CAP VALUE FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks to provide long term growth of capital primarily through investment in equity securities.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund pursues its objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of equity securities such as common stocks of issuers across the capitalization spectrum and identified by the Adviser as having value characteristics.

In other words the individual stocks in the Fund may not perform as well as expected and or the Fund’s portfolio management practices do not work to achieve their desired result. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets.

The value of options can be highly volatile and their use can result in loss if the Adviser is incorrect in its expectation of price fluctuations. ● Small Mid Cap Companies Risk. Investing in securities of companies with micro small or mid sized capitalizations tends to be riskier than investing in securities of companies with large capitalizations. Securities of companies with micro small and mid sized capitalizations tend to be more volatile than those of large cap companies and on occasion may fluctuate in the opposite direction of large cap company securities or the broader stock market averages. The small capitalization equity securities in which the Fund invests may be traded only in the over the counter market or on a regional securities exchange may be listed only in the quotation service commonly known as the “pink sheets ” and may not be traded every day or in the volume typical of trading on a national securities exchange. These securities may also be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The trading market for any given small capitalization equity security may be sufficiently small as to make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a substantial block of such securities. The sale by the Fund of portfolio securities to meet redemptions may require the Fund to sell its small capitalization securities at a discount from market prices or during periods when in the Adviser’s judgment such sale is not desirable. Moreover the lack of an efficient market for these securities may make them difficult to value.'}, 12: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS SMALL CAP VALUE FUND II', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks to provide long term growth of capital primarily through investment in equity securities.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund pursues its objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of equity securities such as common stocks of issuers with small market capitalizations and identified by the Adviser as having value characteristics. A small market capitalization issuer generally is considered to be one whose market capitalization is at the time the Fund makes the investment similar to the market capitalization of companies in the Russell 2000® Value Index. The Russell 2000® Value Index is an unmanaged index that contains stocks from the Russell 2000® Index with less than average growth orientation. As of November 30 2021 the median market capitalization of the Russell 2000® Value Index was 1.0 billion and the largest stock was 18.3 billion. Please note that this range is as of a particular point in time and is subject to change. The Fund generally invests in the equity securities of small companies. The Adviser will seek to invest in companies it considers to be well managed and to have attractive fundamental financial characteristics. The Adviser believes greater potential for price appreciation exists among small companies since they tend to be less widely followed by other securities analysts and thus may be more likely to be undervalued by the market. The Fund may invest from time to time a portion of its assets not to exceed 20 (under normal conditions) at the time of purchase in companies with larger market capitalizations.

Because of the price volatility of IPO shares the Fund may choose to hold IPO shares for a very short period of time. This may increase the turnover of the Fund’s portfolio and may lead to increased expenses to the Fund such as commissions and transaction costs. In addition the Adviser cannot guarantee continued access to IPOs. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. In other words the individual stocks in the Fund may not perform as well as expected and or the Fund’s portfolio management practices do not work to achieve their desired result. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the prices of these stocks will not move even lower. ● Small Cap Companies Risk. The Fund will invest in smaller issuers which are more volatile and less liquid than investments in issuers with a market capitalization greater than the market capitalization of companies in the Russell 2000® Value Index. Small market capitalization issuers are not as diversified in their business activities as issuers with market capitalizations greater than the market capitalization of companies in the Russell 2000® Value Index and are more susceptible to changes in the business cycle. The small capitalization equity securities in which the Fund invests may be traded only in the over the counter market or on a regional securities exchange may be listed only in the quotation service commonly known as the “pink sheets ” and may not be traded every day or in the volume typical of trading on a national securities exchange. These securities may also be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The trading market for any given small capitalization equity security may be sufficiently small as to make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a substantial block of such securities. The sale by the Fund of portfolio securities to meet redemptions may require the Fund to sell its small capitalization securities at a discount from market prices or during periods when in the Adviser’s judgment such sale is not desirable. Moreover the lack of an efficient market for these securities may make them difficult to value.'}, 13: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS GLOBAL EQUITY FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks to provide long term capital growth.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund pursues its objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in a non diversified portfolio of equity and equity related securities issued by U.S. and non U.S. companies of any capitalization size. The Fund may invest in all types of equity and equity related securities including without limitation exchange traded and over the counter common and preferred stocks warrants options rights convertible securities sponsored and unsponsored depositary receipts and shares trust certificates participatory notes limited partnership interests shares of other investment companies (including exchanged traded funds (“ETFs”)) real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and equity participation. An equity participation is a type of loan that gives the lender a portion of equity ownership in a property in addition to principal and interest payments. A convertible security is a bond debenture note preferred stock or other security that may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock of the same or a different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula. The Fund defines non U.S. companies as companies (i) that are organized under the laws of a foreign country (ii) whose principal trading market is in a foreign country or (iii) that have a majority of their assets or that derive a significant portion of their revenue or profits from businesses investments or sales outside of the United States. Under normal market conditions the Fund invests significantly (ordinarily at least 40 — unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the Adviser in which case the Fund would invest at least 30 ) in non U.S. companies. The Fund principally will be invested in issuers located in countries with developed securities markets but may also invest in issuers located in emerging markets. The Fund will allocate its assets among various regions and countries including the United States (but in no less than three different countries). The Fund generally invests in the equity securities of issuers believed by the Adviser to be undervalued in the marketplace focusing on issuers that combine attractive valuations with catalysts for change. The Adviser applies a bottom up stock selection process (i.e. one that focuses primarily on issuer specific factors) in managing the Fund using a combination of fundamental and quantitative analysis. In selecting investments for the Fund the Adviser considers various factors such as price to book value price to sales and earnings ratios dividend yields strength of management and cash flow to identify securities that are trading at a price that appears to be lower than the issuer’s inherent value. The Adviser will sell a stock when it no longer meets one or more investment criteria either through obtaining target value or due to an adverse change in fundamentals or business momentum. Each holding has a target valuation established at purchase which the Adviser constantly monitors and adjusts as appropriate. The Fund may (but is not required to) invest in derivatives including put and call options futures forward contracts and swaps in lieu of investing directly in a security currency or instrument for hedging and non hedging purposes. The Fund may invest up to 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments including investments that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale. The Fund may participate as a purchaser in initial public offerings of securities (“IPO”).An IPO is a company’s first offering of stock to the public. The Fund may also seek to increase its income by lending portfolio securities. 16 While the Adviser intends to fully invest the Fund’s assets at all times in accordance with the above mentioned policies the Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and eligible U.S. dollar denominated money market instruments and make investments inconsistent with its investment objective. The Adviser will determine when market conditions warrant temporary defensive measures.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The Fund’s principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to facilitate finding particular risks and comparing them with other funds. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● Convertible Securities Risk. Securities that can be converted into common stock such as certain securities and preferred stock are subject to the usual risks associated with fixed income investments such as interest rate risk and credit risk. In addition because they react to changes in the value of the equity securities into which they will convert convertible securities are also subject to the risks associated with equity securities. ● Currency Risk. Investment in foreign securities also involves currency risk associated with securities that trade or are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and which may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. An increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a foreign currency may cause the U.S. dollar value of an investment in that country to decline. Foreign currencies also are subject to risks caused by inflation interest rates budget deficits and low savings rates political factors and government controls. ● Cyber Security Risk. Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or its investment adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivative instruments which include futures and options on securities securities indices or currencies options on these futures forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate or currency swaps may be leveraged and result in losses exceeding the amounts invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. 17 ● Emerging Markets Risk. Investment in emerging market securities involves greater risk than that associated with investment in securities of issuers in developed foreign countries. These risks include volatile currency exchange rates periods of high inflation increased risk of default greater social economic and political uncertainty and instability less governmental supervision and regulation of securities markets weaker auditing and financial reporting standards lack of liquidity in the markets and the significantly smaller market capitalizations of emerging market issuers. The information available about an emerging market issuer may be less reliable than for comparable issuers in more developed capital markets. ● Exchange Traded Fund Risk. Exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses.Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their net asset value (“NAV”). ● Foreign Custody Risk. The Fund may hold foreign securities and cash with foreign banks agents and securities depositories appointed by the Fund’s custodian (each a “Foreign Custodian”). Some Foreign Custodians may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business. In some countries Foreign Custodians may be subject to little or no regulatory oversight over or independent evaluation of their operations. Further the laws of certain countries may place limitations on the Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a Foreign Custodian enters bankruptcy. Investments in emerging markets may be subject to even greater custody risks than investments in more developed markets. Custody services in emerging market countries are very often undeveloped and may be considerably less well regulated than in more developed countries and thus may not afford the same level of investor protection as would apply in developed countries. ● Foreign Securities Risk. International investing may be subject to special risks including but not limited to currency exchange rate volatility political social or economic instability less publicly available information less stringent investor protections and differences in taxation auditing and other financial practices. The Fund may invest in securities of foreign issuers either directly or through depositary receipts. Depositary receipts may be available through “sponsored” or “unsponsored” facilities. Holders of unsponsored depositary receipts generally bear all of the costs of the unsponsored facility. The depository of an unsponsored facility is frequently under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the issuer of the deposited security or to pass through to the holders of the receipts voting rights with respect to the deposited securities. The depository of unsponsored depositary receipts may provide less information to receipt holders. Participatory notes (“P notes”) are derivative instruments used by investors to take positions in certain foreign securities. P notes present similar risks to investing directly in such securities and also expose investors to counterparty risk. Foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be traded in markets that close before the time that the Fund calculates its NAV. Furthermore certain foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not calculate its NAV. As a result the value of the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. 18 ● Illiquid Investments Risk. Investing in illiquid investments is subject to certain risks such as limitations on resale and uncertainty in determining valuation. Limitations on resale may adversely affect the marketability of portfolio securities and the Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid investments promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days. The Fund might in order to dispose of restricted securities have to register securities resulting in additional expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of such securities. Less liquid securities that the Fund may want to invest in may be difficult or impossible to purchase. Federal banking regulations may also cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of certain securities which may further decrease the Fund’s ability to buy or sell such securities. ● IPO Risk. IPO risk is the risk that the market value of IPO shares will fluctuate considerably due to certain factors such as the absence of a prior public market unseasoned trading the small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer. The purchase of IPO shares may involve high transaction costs. IPO shares are subject to market risk and liquidity risk. When the Fund’s asset base is small a significant portion of the Fund’s performance could be attributable to investments in IPOs because such investments would have a magnified impact on the Fund. As the Fund’s assets grow the effect of the Fund’s investments in IPOs on the Fund’s performance probably will decline which could reduce the Fund’s performance. Because of the price volatility of IPO shares the Fund may choose to hold IPO shares for a very short period of time. This may increase the turnover of the Fund’s portfolio and may lead to increased expenses to the Fund such as commissions and transaction costs. In addition the Adviser cannot guarantee continued access to IPOs. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. In other words the individual stocks in the Fund may not perform as well as expected and or the Fund’s portfolio management practices do not work to achieve their desired result. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the prices of these stocks will not move even lower. ● Non Diversification Risk. The Fund is non diversified. Compared to other funds the Fund may invest more of its assets in a smaller number of companies. Gains or losses on a single stock may have greater impact on the Fund. ● Options Risk. An option is a type of derivative instrument that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy (a “call”) or sell (a “put”) an asset in the near future at an agreed upon price prior to the expiration date of the option. The Fund may “cover” a call option by owning the security underlying the option or through other means. The value of options can be highly volatile and their use can result in loss if the Adviser is incorrect in its expectation of price fluctuations. ● REITs Risk. REITs may be affected by economic forces and other factors related to the real estate industry. These risks include possible declines in the value of real estate possible lack of availability of mortgage fund and unexpected vacancies of properties. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers self liquidation interest rate risks (especially mortgage REITs) and liquidity risk. REITs that invest in real estate mortgages are also subject to prepayment risk. Investing in REITs may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies. REITs may have limited financial resources may trade less frequently and in a limited volume engage in dilutive offerings and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically small capitalization stocks such as REITs have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in the S P 500® Index. In addition REITs could possibly fail to (i) qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable tax law or (ii) maintain their exemptions from registrations under the 1940 Act. 19 ● Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend portfolio securities to institutions such as certain broker dealers. The Fund may experience a loss or delay in the recovery of its securities if the borrowing institution breaches its agreement with the Fund. ● Small Mid Cap Companies Risk. Investing in securities of companies with micro small or mid sized capitalizations tends to be riskier than investing in securities of companies with large capitalizations. Securities of companies with micro small and mid sized capitalizations tend to be more volatile than those of large cap companies and on occasion may fluctuate in the opposite direction of large cap company securities or the broader stock market averages. The small capitalization equity securities in which the Fund invests may be traded only in the over the counter market or on a regional securities exchange may be listed only in the quotation service commonly known as the “pink sheets ” and may not be traded every day or in the volume typical of trading on a national securities exchange. These securities may also be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The trading market for any given small capitalization equity security may be sufficiently small as to make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a substantial block of such securities. Redemptions may require the Fund to sell its small capitalization securities at a discount from market prices or during periods when in the Adviser’s judgment such sale is not desirable. Moreover the lack of an efficient market for these securities may make them difficult to value.'}, 14: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS LONG SHORT EQUITY FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks long term capital appreciation while reducing exposure to general equity market risk.

The cash proceeds from short sales will be invested in short term cash instruments to produce a return on such proceeds just below the federal funds rate. Short sales are considered speculative transactions and a form of leverage. The Fund invests both long and short in securities principally traded in the United States markets. The Fund may invest in securities of companies operating for three years or less (“unseasoned issuers”). The Adviser will determine the size of each long or short position by analyzing the tradeoff between the attractiveness of each position and its impact on the risk of the overall portfolio. The Fund seeks to construct a portfolio that has less volatility than the United States equity market generally. The Adviser examines various factors in determining the value characteristics of such issuers including price to book value ratios and price to earnings ratios. These value characteristics are examined in the context of the issuer’s operating and financial fundamentals such as return on equity earnings growth and cash flow. The Adviser selects securities for the Fund based on a continuous study of trends in industries and companies earnings power and growth and other investment criteria. The Adviser will sell a stock when it no longer meets one or more investment criteria either through obtaining target value or due to an adverse change in fundamentals or business momentum. Each holding has a target valuation established at purchase which the Adviser constantly monitors and adjusts as appropriate. The Fund intends under normal circumstances to invest at least 80 of its net assets (including borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities. Under normal circumstances the Adviser expects that the Fund’s long positions will not exceed approximately 125 of the Fund’s net assets. The Fund’s long and short positions may involve (without limit) equity securities of foreign issuers that are traded in the markets of the United States. The Fund may also invest up to 20 of its total assets directly in equity securities of foreign issuers. To meet margin requirements redemptions or pending investments the Fund may also temporarily hold a portion of its assets in full faith and credit obligations of the United States government and in short term notes commercial paper or other money market instruments. The Fund may participate as a purchaser in initial public offerings of securities (“IPO”). An IPO is a company’s first offering of stock to the public. The Fund may invest from time to time a significant portion of its assets in smaller issuers which are more volatile and less liquid than investments in issuers with larger market capitalizations. The Fund may invest up to 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments including investments that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale.

As a result the value of the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. ● High Yield Debt Obligations Risk. The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations such as bonds and debentures issued by corporations and other business organizations. An issuer of debt obligations may default on its obligation to pay interest and repay principal. Also changes in the financial strength of an issuer or changes in the credit rating of a security may affect its value. Such high yield debt obligations are referred to as “junk bonds” and are not considered to be investment grade. 25 ● Illiquid Investments Risk. Investing in illiquid investments is subject to certain risks such as limitations on resale and uncertainty in determining valuation. Limitations on resale may adversely affect the marketability of portfolio securities and the Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid investments promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days.

This may increase the turnover of the Fund’s portfolio and may lead to increased expenses to the Fund such as commissions and transaction costs. In addition the Adviser cannot guarantee continued access to IPOs. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. In other words the Adviser may not be successful in its strategy of taking long positions in stocks the manager believes to be undervalued and short positions in stocks the manager believes to be overvalued. Further since the Adviser will manage both a long and a short portfolio there is the risk that the Adviser may make more poor investment decisions than an adviser of a typical stock mutual fund with only a long portfolio may make. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the long portfolio of the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the prices of these stocks will not move even lower. ● Portfolio Turnover Risk. If the Fund frequently trades its portfolio securities the Fund will incur higher brokerage commissions and transaction costs which could lower the Fund’s performance. In addition to lower performance high portfolio turnover could result in taxable capital gains. A portfolio turnover rate of 100 is considered to be high. The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Fund is not expected to exceed 400 however it may be higher if the Adviser believes it will improve the Fund’s performance. ● Segregated Account Risk. A security held in a segregated account cannot be sold while the position it is covering is outstanding unless it is replaced with a similar security. As a result there is a possibility that segregation of a large percentage of the Fund’s assets could impede portfolio management or the Fund’s ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations. ● Short Sales Risk. Short sales of securities may result in gains if a security’s price declines but may result in losses if a security’s price rises. 26 ● Small Cap Companies Risk. The small capitalization equity securities in which the Fund may invest may be traded only in the over the counter market or on a regional securities exchange may be listed only in the quotation service commonly known as the “pink sheets ” and may not be traded every day or in the volume typical of trading on a national securities exchange. These securities may also be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The trading market for any given small capitalization equity security may be sufficiently small as to make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a substantial block of such securities.

Moreover the lack of an efficient market for these securities may make them difficult to value. ● Unseasoned Issuers Risk. Unseasoned issuers may not have an established financial history and may have limited product lines markets or financial resources. Unseasoned issuers may depend on a few key personnel for management and may be susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy. As a result such securities may be more volatile and difficult to sell.'}, 15: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS LONG SHORT RESEARCH FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks to provide long term total return.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund uses a hedged strategy.

Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or its investment adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivative instruments which include futures and options on securities securities indices or currencies options on these futures forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate or currency swaps may be leveraged and result in losses exceeding the amounts invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. ● Exchange Traded Fund Risk. Exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an Adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their net asset value (“NAV”). 32 ● Foreign Custody Risk. The Fund may hold foreign securities and cash with foreign banks agents and securities depositories appointed by the Fund’s custodian (each a “Foreign Custodian”). Some Foreign Custodians may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business. In some countries Foreign Custodians may be subject to little or no regulatory oversight over or independent evaluation of their operations. Further the laws of certain countries may place limitations on the Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a Foreign Custodian enters bankruptcy. Investments in emerging markets may be subject to even greater custody risks than investments in more developed markets. Custody services in emerging market countries are very often undeveloped and may be considerably less well regulated than in more developed countries and thus may not afford the same level of investor protection as would apply in developed countries. ● Foreign Securities Risk. International investing may be subject to special risks including currency exchange rate volatility political social or economic instability less publicly available information less stringent investor protections and differences in taxation auditing and financial practices. Foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be traded in markets that close before the time that the Fund calculates its NAV. Furthermore certain foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not calculate its NAV. As a result the value of the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. ● High Yield Debt Obligations Risk. The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations (of any rating including defaulted securities and unrated securities) including bonds and debentures issued by corporations and business organizations. An issuer of debt obligations may default on its obligation to pay interest and repay principal. Also changes in the financial strength of an issuer or changes in the credit rating of a security may affect its value. Such high yield debt obligations are referred to as “junk bonds” and are not considered to be investment grade. ● Illiquid Investments Risk. Investing in illiquid investments is subject to certain risks such as limitations on resale and uncertainty in determining valuation. Limitations on resale may adversely affect the marketability of portfolio securities and the Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid investments promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days. Less liquid securities that the fund may want to invest in may be difficult or impossible to purchase. Federal banking regulations may also cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of certain securities which may further decrease the Fund’s ability to buy or sell such securities. ● Indexed Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in indexed securities whose value is linked to securities indices. Most such securities have values that rise and fall according to the change in one or more specified indices and may have characteristics similar to direct investments in the underlying securities. Depending on the index such securities may have greater volatility than the market as a whole. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. The Adviser may be incorrect in the stocks it buys and believes to be undervalued and in stocks it sells short and believes to be overvalued. Further since the Adviser will manage both a long and a short portfolio there is the risk that the Adviser may make more poor investment decisions than an adviser of a typical stock mutual fund with only a long portfolio. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the long portfolio of the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the price of these stocks will not move even lower. 33 ● Portfolio Turnover Risk. If the Fund frequently trades its portfolio securities the Fund will incur higher brokerage commissions and transaction costs which could lower the Fund’s performance. In addition to lower performance high portfolio turnover could result in taxable capital gains. A portfolio turnover rate of 100 is considered to be high. The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Fund is not expected to exceed 300 however it may be higher if the Adviser believes it will improve the Fund’s performance. ● REITs Risk. REITs may be affected by economic forces and other factors related to the real estate industry. These risks include possible declines in the value of real estate possible lack of availability of mortgage funds and unexpected vacancies of properties. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers self liquidation interest rate risks (especially mortgage REITs) and liquidity risk. REITs that invest in real estate mortgages are also subject to prepayment risk. Investing in REITs may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies. REITs may have limited financial resources may trade less frequently and in a limited volume engage in dilutive offerings and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically small capitalization stocks such as REITs have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in the S P 500® Index. In addition REITs could possibly fail to (i) qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable tax law or (ii) maintain their exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act. ● Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend portfolio securities to institutions such as certain broker dealers. The Fund may experience a loss or delay in the recovery of its securities if the borrowing institution breaches its agreement with the Fund. ● Short Sales Risk. Short sales of securities may result in gains if a security’s price declines but may result in losses if a security’s price rises. In a rising market short positions may be more likely to result in losses because securities sold short may be more likely to increase in value. Short selling also involves the risks of increased leverage and its accompanying potential for losses the potential inability to reacquire a security in a timely manner or at an acceptable price the possibility of the lender terminating the loan at any time forcing the Fund to close the transaction under unfavorable circumstances the additional costs that may be incurred and the potential loss of investment flexibility caused by the Fund’s obligations to provide collateral to the lender and set aside assets to cover the open position. Short sales “against the box” may protect the Fund against the risk of losses in the value of a portfolio security because any decline in value of the security should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding gain in the short position. Any potential gains in the security however would be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding loss in the short position. Short sales that are not “against the box” involve a form of investment leverage and the amount of the Fund’s loss on a short sale is potentially unlimited. ● Small Cap Companies Risk. The small capitalization equity securities in which the Fund may invest may be traded only in the over the counter market or on a regional securities exchange may be listed only in the quotation service commonly known as the “pink sheets ” and may not be traded every day or in the volume typical of trading on a national securities exchange. These securities may also be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The trading market for any given small capitalization equity security may be sufficiently small as to make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a substantial block of such securities. The sale by the Fund of portfolio securities to meet redemptions may require the Fund to sell its small capitalization securities at a discount from market prices or during periods when in the Adviser’s judgment such sale is not desirable. Moreover the lack of an efficient market for these securities may make them difficult to value. ● Unseasoned Issuers Risk. Unseasoned issuers may not have an established financial history and may have limited product lines markets or financial resources. Unseasoned issuers may depend on a few key personnel for management and may be susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy. As a result such securities may be more volatile and difficult to sell.'}, 16: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BOSTON PARTNERS GLOBAL LONG SHORT FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Fund seeks long term growth of capital.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund invests in long positions in stocks identified by the Adviser as undervalued and takes short positions in stocks that the Adviser has identified as overvalued. The cash proceeds from short sales will be invested in short term cash instruments to produce a return on such proceeds just below the federal funds rate. Short sales are considered speculative transactions and a form of leverage The Fund invests both long and short in securities issued by U.S. and non U.S. companies of any capitalization size. 37 With a long position the Fund purchases a stock outright with a short position the Fund sells a security that it does not own and must borrow to meet its settlement obligations. The Fund may invest in securities of companies operating for three years or less (“unseasoned issuers”). The Adviser will determine the size of each long or short position by analyzing the tradeoff between the attractiveness of each position and its impact on the risk of the overall portfolio. The Adviser examines various factors in determining the value characteristics of such issuers including price to book value ratios and price to earnings ratios. These value characteristics are examined in the context of the issuer’s operating and financial fundamentals including return on equity earnings growth and cash flow. The Adviser selects securities for the Fund based on a continuous study of trends in industries and companies earnings power and growth and other investment criteria. The Fund may invest in all types of equity and equity related securities including without limitation exchange traded and over the counter common and preferred stocks warrants options rights convertible securities sponsored and unsponsored depositary receipts and shares trust certificates limited partnership interests shares of other investment companies (including exchanged traded funds (“ETFs”)) real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and equity participation. An equity participation is a type of loan that gives the lender a portion of equity ownership in a property in addition to principal and interest payments. A convertible security is a bond debenture note preferred stock or other security that may be converted into or exchanged for a prescribed amount of common stock of the same or a different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula. The Fund defines non U.S. companies as companies (i) that are organized under the laws of a foreign country (ii) whose principal trading market is in a foreign country or (iii) that have a majority of their assets or that derive a significant portion of their revenue or profits from businesses investments or sales outside of the United States. Under normal market conditions the Fund invests significantly (ordinarily at least 40 — unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the Adviser in which case the Fund would invest at least 30 ) in non U.S. companies. The Fund principally will be invested in issuers located in countries with developed securities markets but may also invest in issuers located in emerging markets. The Fund will allocate its assets among various regions and countries including the United States (but in no less than three different countries). The Fund’s portfolio is rebalanced regularly. The Adviser assesses each investment’s changing characteristics relative to its contribution to portfolio risk. The Adviser will sell an investment held long or close out a short position that the Adviser believes no longer offers an appropriate return to risk trade off. Under normal circumstances the Adviser expects to sell securities short so that the Fund’s portfolio is approximately 50 net long with an average of between 30 and 70 net long. To meet margin requirements redemptions or pending investments the Fund may also temporarily hold a portion of its assets in full faith and credit obligations of the United States government and in short term notes commercial paper or other money market instruments. The Adviser will sell a stock when it no longer meets one or more investment criteria either through obtaining target value or due to an adverse change in fundamentals or business momentum. Each holding has a target valuation established at purchase which the Adviser constantly monitors and adjusts as appropriate. The Fund may participate as a purchaser in initial public offerings of securities (“IPO”). An IPO is a company’s first offering of stock to the public. The Fund may invest from time to time a significant portion of its assets in smaller issuers which are more volatile and less liquid than investments in issuers with larger market capitalizations. The Fund may invest up to 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments including investements that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market or legal or contractual restrictions on resale. In general the Fund’s investments are broadly diversified over a number of industries and as a matter of policy the Fund is limited to investing a maximum of 25 of its total assets in any one industry. The Fund is non diversified and may invest in fewer securities at any one time than a diversified fund. 38 The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations such as bonds and debentures used by U.S. and foreign corporations and other business organizations (e.g. trusts or limited liability companies). Such high yield debt obligations are not considered to be investment grade. Non investment grade fixed income securities (commonly known as “junk bonds”) are rated BB or lower by S P Global or have a comparable rating by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization (or if unrated are determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality at the time of investment). The Fund may invest in securities of the lowest rating category including securities in default. The Adviser may but is not required to sell a bond or note held by the Fund in the event that its credit rating is downgraded. The Fund may (but is not required to) invest in derivatives including put and call options futures forward contracts and swaps in lieu of investing directly in a security currency or instrument for hedging and non hedging purposes. While the Adviser intends to fully invest the Fund’s assets at all times in accordance with the above mentioned policies the Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and eligible U.S. dollar denominated money market instruments and make investments inconsistent with its investment objectives. The Adviser will determine when market conditions warrant temporary defensive measures.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The Fund’s principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to facilitate finding particular risks and comparing them with other funds. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● Convertible Securities Risk. Securities that can be converted into common stock such as certain securities and preferred stock are subject to the usual risks associated with fixed income investments such as interest rate risk and credit risk. In addition because they react to changes in the value of the equity securities into which they will convert convertible securities are also subject to the risks associated with equity securities. ● Currency Risk. Investment in foreign securities also involves currency risk associated with securities that trade or are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and which may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. An increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to a foreign currency may cause the U.S. dollar value of an investment in that country to decline. Foreign currencies also are subject to risks caused by inflation interest rates budget deficits and low savings rates political factors and government controls. ● Cyber Security Risk. Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or its investment adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. 39 ● Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivative instruments which include futures and options on securities securities indices or currencies options on these futures forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate or currency swaps may be leveraged and result in losses exceeding the amounts invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. ● Emerging Markets Risk. Investment in emerging market securities involves greater risk than that associated with investment in securities of issuers in developed foreign countries. These risks include volatile currency exchange rates periods of high inflation increased risk of default greater social economic and political uncertainty and instability less governmental supervision and regulation of securities markets weaker auditing and financial reporting standards lack of liquidity in the markets and the significantly smaller market capitalizations of emerging market issuers. The information available about an emerging market issuer may be less reliable than for comparable issuers in more developed capital markets. ● Exchange Traded Fund Risk. Exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their net asset value (“NAV”). ● Foreign Custody Risk. The Fund may hold foreign securities and cash with foreign banks agents and securities depositories appointed by the Fund’s custodian (each a “Foreign Custodian”). Some Foreign Custodians may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business. In some countries Foreign Custodians may be subject to little or no regulatory oversight over or independent evaluation of their operations. Further the laws of certain countries may place limitations on the Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a Foreign Custodian enters bankruptcy. Investments in emerging markets may be subject to even greater custody risks than investments in more developed markets. Custody services in emerging market countries are very often undeveloped and may be considerably less well regulated than in more developed countries and thus may not afford the same level of investor protection as would apply in developed countries. ● Foreign Securities Risk. International investing may be subject to special risks including but not limited to currency exchange rate volatility political social or economic instability less publicly available information less stringent investor protections and differences in taxation auditing and other financial practices. The Fund may invest in securities of foreign issuers either directly or through depositary receipts. Depositary receipts may be available through “sponsored” or “unsponsored” facilities. Holders of unsponsored depositary receipts generally bear all of the costs of the unsponsored facility. The depository of an unsponsored facility is frequently under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the issuer of the deposited security or to pass through to the holders of the receipts voting rights with respect to the deposited securities. The depository of unsponsored depositary receipts may provide less information to receipt holders. Participatory notes (“P notes”) are derivative instruments used by investors to take positions in certain foreign securities. P notes present similar risks to investing directly in such securities and also expose investors to counterparty risk. Foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be traded in markets that close before the time that the Fund calculates its NAV. Furthermore certain foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not calculate its NAV. As a result the value of the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. 40 ● High Yield Debt Obligations Risk. The Fund may invest up to 20 of its net assets in high yield debt obligations such as bonds and debentures issued by corporations and other business organizations. An issuer of debt obligations may default on its obligation to pay interest and repay principal. Also changes in the financial strength of an issuer or changes in the credit rating of a security may affect its value. Such high yield debt obligations are referred to as “junk bonds” and are not considered to be investment grade. ● Illiquid Investments Risk. Investing in illiquid investments is subject to certain risks such as limitations on resale and uncertainty in determining valuation. Limitations on resale may adversely affect the marketability of portfolio securities and the Fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid investments promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days. The Fund might in order to dispose of restricted securities have to register securities resulting in additional expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of such securities. Less liquid securities that the Fund may want to invest in may be difficult or impossible to purchase. Federal banking regulations may also cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of certain securities which may further decrease the Fund’s ability to buy or sell such securities. ● IPO Risk. IPO risk is the risk that the market value of IPO shares will fluctuate considerably due to certain factors such as the absence of a prior public market unseasoned trading the small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer. The purchase of IPO shares may involve high transaction costs. IPO shares are subject to market risk and liquidity risk. When the Fund’s asset base is small a significant portion of the Fund’s performance could be attributable to investments in IPOs because such investments would have a magnified impact on the Fund. As the Fund’s assets grow the effect of the Fund’s investments in IPOs on the Fund’s performance probably will decline which could reduce the Fund’s performance. Because of the price volatility of IPO shares the Fund may choose to hold IPO shares for a very short period of time. This may increase the turnover of the Fund’s portfolio and may lead to increased expenses to the Fund such as commissions and transaction costs. In addition the Adviser cannot guarantee continued access to IPOs. ● Management Risk. The Fund is subject to the risk of poor stock selection. In other words the Adviser may not be successful in its strategy of taking long positions in stocks the manager believes to be undervalued and short positions in stocks the manager believes to be overvalued. Further since the Adviser will manage both a long and a short portfolio there is the risk that the Adviser may make more poor investment decisions than an adviser of a typical stock mutual fund with only a long portfolio may make. ● Market Risk. The NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the market value of its portfolio positions. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. Investors may lose money. Although the long portfolio of the Fund will invest in stocks the Adviser believes to be undervalued there is no guarantee that the prices of these stocks will not move even lower. ● Non Diversification Risk. The Fund is non diversified. Compared to other funds the Fund may invest more of its assets in a smaller number of companies. Gains or losses on a single stock may have greater impact on the Fund. ● Options Risk. An option is a type of derivative instrument that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy (a “call”) or sell (a “put”) an asset in the near future at an agreed upon price prior to the expiration date of the option. The Fund may “cover” a call option by owning the security underlying the option or through other means. The value of options can be highly volatile and their use can result in loss if the Adviser is incorrect in its expectation of price fluctuations. Losses incurred by the Fund in writing options can be potentially unlimited. 41 ● Portfolio Turnover Risk. If the Fund frequently trades its portfolio securities the Fund will incur higher brokerage commissions and transaction costs which could lower the Fund’s performance. In addition to lower performance high portfolio turnover could result in taxable capital gains. A portfolio turnover rate of 100 is considered to be high. The annual portfolio turnover rate for the Fund is not expected to exceed 400 however it may be higher if the Adviser believes it will improve the Fund’s performance. ● REITs Risk. REITs may be affected by economic forces and other factors related to the real estate industry. These risks include possible declines in the value of real estate possible lack of availability of mortgage funds and unexpected vacancies of properties. REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers self liquidation interest rate risks (especially mortgage REITs) and liquidity risk. REITs that invest in real estate mortgages are also subject to prepayment risk. Investing in REITs may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small capitalization companies. REITs may have limited financial resources may trade less frequently and in a limited volume engage in dilutive offerings and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically small capitalization stocks such as REITs have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in the S P 500® Index. In addition REITs could possibly fail to (i) qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable tax law or (ii) maintain their exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act. ● Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend portfolio securities to institutions such as certain broker dealers. The Fund may experience a loss or delay in the recovery of its securities if the borrowing institution breaches its agreement with the Fund. ● Short Sales Risk. Short sales of securities may result in gains if a security’s price declines but may result in losses if a security’s price rises. In a rising market short positions may be more likely to result in losses because securities sold short may be more likely to increase in value. Short selling also involves the risks of increased leverage and its accompanying potential for losses the potential inability to reacquire a security in a timely manner or at an acceptable price the possibility of the lender terminating the loan at any time forcing the Fund to close the transaction under unfavorable circumstances the additional costs that may be incurred and the potential loss of investment flexibility caused by the Fund’s obligations to provide collateral to the lender and set aside assets to cover the open position. Short sales “against the box” may protect the Fund against the risk of losses in the value of a portfolio security because any decline in value of the security should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding gain in the short position. Any potential gains in the security however would be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding loss in the short position. Short sales that are not “against the box” involve a form of investment leverage and the amount of the Fund’s loss on a short sale is potentially unlimited. The use of short sales may cause the Fund to have higher expenses than those of other equity mutual funds because of higher transaction costs premiums interest or dividends payable to the lender. ● Segregated Account Risk. A security held in a segregated account cannot be sold while the position it is covering is outstanding unless it is replaced with a similar security. As a result there is a possibility that segregation of a large percentage of the Fund’s assets could impede portfolio management or the Fund’s ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations. ● Small Cap Companies Risk. The small capitalization equity securities in which the Fund may invest may be traded only in the over the counter market or on a regional securities exchange may be listed only in the quotation service commonly known as the “pink sheets ” and may not be traded every day or in the volume typical of trading on a national securities exchange. These securities may also be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The trading market for any given small capitalization equity security may be sufficiently small as to make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of a substantial block of such securities. The sale by the Fund of portfolio securities to meet redemptions may require the Fund to sell its small capitalization securities at a discount from market prices or during periods when in the Adviser’s judgment such sale is not desirable. Moreover the lack of an efficient market for these securities may make them difficult to value. 42 ● Unseasoned Issuers Risk. Unseasoned issuers may not have an established financial history and may have limited product lines markets or financial resources. Unseasoned issuers may depend on a few key personnel for management and may be susceptible to losses and risks of bankruptcy. As a result such securities may be more volatile and difficult to sell.'}, 17: {'mutual_fund_name': 'FREE MARKET U.S. EQUITY FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The investment objective of the Campbell Systematic Macro Fund (the “Fund”) is to seek capital appreciation over the medium to long term.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund pursues its investment objective by (i) investing its assets pursuant to the Campbell Systematic Macro Program (ii) allocating up to 25 of its total assets in its wholly owned subsidiary Campbell Systematic Macro Offshore Limited (the “Subsidiary”) which is organized under the acts of the Cayman Islands and employs the Adviser’s Campbell Systematic Macro Program (as described below) and (iii) allocating the remainder of its assets directly in a portfolio of investment grade securities (including government securities) for cash management purposes. Securities rated in the four highest categories by the ratings agencies are considered investment grade. The Fund invests pursuant to the Adviser’s Campbell Systematic Macro Program which uses quantitative modeling to develop and maintain systematic trading strategies driven by scientific analysis of financial data across global financial and commodity markets. The Campbell Systematic Macro Program seeks to systematically identify price trends and to develop macro and fundamental themes that exploit asset mispricing. As a pioneer in systematic trend following innovating modeling techniques can be developed to extract relationships and to identify trends occurring within and across markets and asset classes globally. Other complimentary systematic strategies are incorporated such as relative value (i.e. a trading strategy that looks for opportunities based on an asset’s value as compared to the value of similar assets. In contrast absolute value looks only at an asset’s intrinsic value and does not compare it to other assets) and mean reversion (i.e. a trading strategy based on the concept that prices and returns eventually move back toward the mean or average. This mean or average can be the historical average of the price or return or another relevant average such as the growth in the economy or the average return of an industry). A systematic process eliminates emotion “key person” risk and provides an ability to participate in trends during periods of extended momentum without any directional bias. Key person risk is the risk that results when a fund’s investment program is highly dependent on the investment skill and dedication of a small number of “key” persons at an adviser which can result in decreased investment results if these “key” persons become unable to apply their full attention to the management of a fund’s investments for health or other reasons. In addition a diversity of investment style and the ability to invest long and short across global asset classes and markets enables investment opportunities in a variety of economic environments. The Fund is generally intended to have a low correlation to the equity bond and credit markets. There is no assurance however that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund intends to trade in a broad range of instruments including but not limited to futures (including commodity futures index futures equity futures bond futures and interest rate futures) currency forwards options and swaps (including commodity swaps swaps on commodity futures equity swaps swaps on index futures total 2 return swaps and interest rate swaps) either by investing directly in the instruments or indirectly by investing in the Subsidiary which invests in the instruments. From time to time the Fund can have significant exposure to non U.S. dollar denominated currencies including emerging markets currencies. The Adviser will attempt to mitigate risk through diversification of holdings and through monitoring of the portfolio the Fund’s counterparties and other risk measures. Individual market positions are constrained to ensure that no one market or asset class represents an outsized portion of the Fund’s portfolio risk. The Adviser evaluates changes in signals daily and execution is controlled by its intraday risk management and execution platform. The Fund may utilize proprietary or third party trading algorithms in order to minimize market impact and reduce trading costs. The Fund is “non diversified” for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (the “1940 Act”) which means that the Fund may invest in fewer securities at any one time than a diversified fund. The Fund may not invest more than 15 of its net assets in illiquid investments. Investments in the Subsidiary which has the same investment objective as the Fund are intended to provide the Fund with indirect exposure to futures contracts and commodities in a manner consistent with the limitations and requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the “Code”) that apply to the Fund which limit the amount of income the Fund may receive from certain sources. Applicable federal tax requirements generally limit the degree to which the Fund may invest in the Subsidiary to an amount not exceeding 25 of its total assets. To the extent they are applicable to the investment activities of the Subsidiary the Subsidiary will be subject to the same investment restrictions and limitations and follow the same compliance policies and procedures as the Fund. The Fund complies with Section 8 and Section 18 of the 1940 Act governing investment policies and capital structure and leverage respectively on an aggregate basis with the Subsidiary. The Subsidiary also complies with Section 17 of the 1940 Act relating to affiliated transactions and custody.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund (and indirectly in the Subsidiary) as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The Fund’s principal risks are presented in alphabetical order to facilitate finding particular risks and comparing them with other funds. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● Commodities Risk Exposure to the commodities markets (including financial futures markets) may subject the Fund through its investment in the Subsidiary to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. Prices of commodities and related contracts may fluctuate significantly over short periods for a variety of reasons including changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as weather disease (including pandemics) tariffs embargoes or other trade barriers acts of war or terrorism or political and regulatory developments. ● Counterparty Risk The derivative contracts entered into by the Fund or its Subsidiary may be privately negotiated in the over the counter market. These contracts also involve exposure to credit risk since contract performance depends in part on the financial condition of the counterparty. Relying on a counterparty exposes the Fund to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem thus causing the Fund to suffer a loss. If a counterparty defaults on its payment obligations to the Fund this default will cause the value of an investment in the Fund to decrease. In addition to the extent the Fund deals with a limited number of counterparties it will be more susceptible to the credit risks associated with those counterparties. The Fund is neither restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty nor from concentrating any or all of its transactions with one counterparty. The ability of the Fund to transact business with any one or number of counterparties and the absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses by the Fund. ● Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the security or a counterparty in respect of a derivative instrument will not be able to satisfy its payment obligations to the Fund when due. This may impair the Fund’s liquidity or cause a deterioration in the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”). In addition the Fund may incur expenses in an effort to protect the Fund’s interests or enforce its rights against an issuer guarantor or counterparty or may be hindered or delayed in exercising these rights. Changes in an issuer’s credit rating or the 3 market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. Securities rated in the four highest categories by the rating agencies are considered investment grade but they may also have some speculative characteristics. Investment grade ratings do not guarantee that bonds will not lose value or default. In addition the credit quality of securities may be lowered if an issuer’s financial condition changes. ● Currency Risk The Fund’s exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. Dollar or in the case of short positions that the U.S. Dollar will decline in value relative to the currency that the Fund is short. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for any number of reasons including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. ● Cyber Security Risk Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the Adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its Adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or the Adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● Derivatives Risk Derivatives include instruments and contracts that are based on and are valued in relation to one or more underlying securities financial benchmarks or indices such as futures options swap agreements and forward contracts. Derivatives typically have economic leverage inherent in their terms. Such leverage will magnify any losses. See “Leverage Volatility Risk” below. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. The primary types of derivatives in which the Fund or its Subsidiary invest in are swap agreements futures contracts and forward contracts. Futures contracts forward contracts and swap agreements can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value and changes in the value of such instruments held directly or indirectly by the Fund may not correlate with the underlying instrument or reference assets or the Fund’s other investments. Although the value of futures contracts forward contracts and swap agreements depends largely upon price movements in the underlying instrument or reference asset there are additional risks associated with futures contracts forward contracts and swap agreements that are possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying instruments or reference assets including illiquidity risk leveraging risk and counterparty credit risk. A small position in futures contracts forward contracts or swap agreements could have a potentially large impact on the Fund’s performance. Trading restrictions or limitations may be imposed by an exchange and government regulations may restrict trading in swap agreements futures contracts and options and forward contracts. ● Emerging Market Risk The Fund intends to have exposure to emerging markets due to the Fund’s investments in certain stock index futures and foreign exchange instruments. Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition many emerging financial markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets are subject to greater social economic and political instability have less governmental supervision and regulation of securities markets and have weaker auditing and financial reporting standards. The information available about an emerging market issuer may be less reliable than for comparable issuers in more developed capital markets. ● Equity Securities Risk The Fund may invest in or have exposure to equity securities. Equity securities tend to be more volatile than other investment choices such as debt and money market instruments. The value of your investment may decrease in response to overall stock market movements or the value of individual securities. ● Fixed Income Risk Fixed income securities such as U.S. Treasuries or derivatives based on fixed income securities are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk as described more fully herein refers to the possibility that the issuer of a debt security will be unable to make interest payments or repay principal when it becomes due. Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a debt security resulting from changes in the 4 general level of interest rates. Prices of fixed income securities tend to move inversely with changes in interest rates. Typically a rise in rates will adversely affect fixed income security prices and accordingly the Fund’s returns and share price. In addition the Fund may be subject to “call” risk which is the risk that during a period of falling interest rates the issuer may redeem a security by repaying it early (which may reduce the Fund’s income if the proceeds are reinvested at lower interest rates) and “extension” risk which occurs during a rising interest rate environment because certain obligations will be paid off by an issuer more slowly than anticipated (causing the value of those securities held by the Fund to fall). ● Foreign Market Risk As a general rule there is less legal and regulatory protection for investors in foreign markets than that available domestically. Additionally trading on foreign exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls expropriation increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability. Some foreign derivative markets are so called principals’ markets in which performance is the responsibility only of the individual counterparty with whom the trader has entered into a commodity interest transaction and not of the exchange or clearing corporation. International trading activities are subject to foreign exchange risk. Certain foreign securities in which the Fund may invest may be traded in markets that close before the time that the Fund calculates its NAV. Furthermore certain foreign securities in which the Fund invests may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not calculate its NAV. As a result the value of the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. ● Futures and Forward Contracts and Related Risks The successful use of forward and futures contracts draws upon the Adviser’s skill and experience with respect to such instruments and are subject to special risk considerations. The primary risks associated with the use of futures and forward contracts are ● Futures and forward contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes ● the imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the forward or futures contracts and the market value of the underlying instrument or reference assets with respect to such contracts ● possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a forward or futures contract and the resulting inability to close a forward or futures contract when desired ● possible market disruption or other extraordinary events including but not limited to governmental intervention ● potentially unlimited losses caused by unanticipated market movements ● the Fund’s inability to predict correctly the direction of securities prices interest rates currency exchange rates and other economic factors ● the possibility that the counterparty will default in the performance of its obligations and ● if the Fund has insufficient cash it may either have to sell securities from its portfolio to meet daily variation margin requirements with respect to its derivative instruments or close certain positions at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. The use of futures contracts forward contracts and derivative instruments will have the economic effect of financial leverage. Financial leverage magnifies exposure to the swings in prices of an asset class underlying an investment and results in increased volatility which means the Fund will have the potential for greater losses than if the Fund did not employ leverage in its investment activity. Leveraging tends to magnify sometimes significantly the effect of any increase or decrease in the Fund’s exposure to an asset class and may cause the value of the Fund’s securities or related derivatives instruments to be volatile. Accordingly the Fund’s NAV may be volatile because of its investment exposure to the Fund. There is no assurance that the Fund’s investment in a derivative instrument with leveraged exposure to certain investments and markets will enable the Fund to achieve its investment objective. ● General Market Risk The Fund’s NAV and investment return will fluctuate based upon changes in the value of its portfolio securities. The value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic political financial public health crises (such as epidemics or pandemics) or other disruptive events (whether real expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. You could lose money on your investment in the Fund or the Fund could underperform other investments. 5 ● Government Agency Risk Direct obligations of the U.S. Government such as Treasury bills notes and bonds are supported by its full faith and credit. Indirect obligations issued by Federal agencies and government sponsored entities generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. Accordingly while U.S. Government agencies and instrumentalities may be chartered or sponsored by Acts of Congress their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Some of these indirect obligations may be supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the Treasury others are supported by the discretionary authority of the U.S. Government to purchase the agency’s obligations still others are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality. The maximum potential liability of the issuers of some U.S. government securities may greatly exceed their current resources including any legal right to support from the U.S. Treasury. It is possible that the issuers of such securities will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. ● Government Intervention and Regulatory Changes The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd Frank Act”) (which was passed into law in July 2010) significantly revised and expanded the rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority of federal bank securities and commodities regulators. There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions including but not limited to those authorized by the Dodd Frank Act will not adversely impact the Fund. Major changes resulting from legislative or regulatory actions could materially affect the profitability of the Fund or the value of investments made by the Fund or force the Fund to revise its investment strategy or divest certain of its investments. Any of these developments could expose the Fund to additional costs taxes liabilities enforcement actions and reputational risk. In addition in October 2020 the SEC adopted new regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies. The Fund will be required to implement and comply with new Rule 18f 4 by the third quarter of 2022. Once implemented Rule 18f 4 will impose limits on the amount of derivatives a fund can enter into eliminate the asset segregation framework currently used by funds to comply with Section 18 of the 1940 Act treat derivatives as senior securities so that a failure to comply with the limits would result in a statutory violation and require funds whose use of derivatives is more than a limited specified exposure to establish and maintain a comprehensive derivatives risk management program and appoint a derivatives risk manager. These rules could have a substantial effect on the ability of the Fund to implement fully its investment strategy as described herein which may limit the Fund’s ability to achieve its objective. ● Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of fixed income securities generally increase when interest rates decline and decrease when interest rates increase. The Fund may lose money if short term or long term interest rates rise sharply or otherwise change in a manner not anticipated by the Adviser. Securities with longer maturities tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates causing them to be more volatile than securities with shorter maturities. Securities with shorter maturities tend to provide lower returns and be less volatile than securities with longer maturities. Changing interest rates may have unpredictable effects on the markets and the Fund’s investments and may also affect the liquidity of fixed income securities and instruments held by the Fund. Recent and any future declines in interest rate levels could cause the Fund’s earnings to fall below the Fund’s expense ratio resulting in a negative yield and a decline in the Fund’s share price. In addition certain countries and regulatory bodies may use negative interest rates as a monetary policy tool to encourage economic growth during periods of deflation. In a negative interest rate environment debt instruments may trade at negative yields which means the purchaser of the instrument may receive at maturity less than the total amount invested. ● Leverage Volatility Risk Although the Fund will not borrow funds for trading the Fund should be considered highly leveraged and is suitable only for investors with high tolerance for investment risk. Leverage embedded in the various derivative instruments traded may result in the Fund or its Subsidiary holding positions whose face or notional value may be many times the Fund’s NAV. For example the amount of margin funds necessary to be deposited in order to enter into a futures forward or option contract position is typically from 2 to 10 of the total face or notional value of the contract. As a result of this leveraging even a small movement in the price of a commodity can cause a correspondingly large profit or loss. Losses incurred on leveraged investments increase in direct proportion to the degree of leverage employed. Furthermore derivative instruments and futures contracts are highly volatile and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial fluctuations. Consequently you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in the Fund should the Fund’s trading positions suddenly turn unprofitable. 6 The Fund’s NAV is expected over short term periods to be volatile because of the significant use of direct and indirect investments that have a leveraging effect. Volatility is a statistical measurement of the magnitude of up and down asset price fluctuations over time. Rapid and dramatic price swings will result in high volatility. The Fund’s returns are expected to be volatile however the actual or realized volatility level for longer or shorter periods may be materially higher or lower depending on market conditions and investors may suffer a significant and possibly a complete loss on their investment in the Fund. ● Liquidity Risk The Fund is subject to liquidity risk primarily due to its investments in derivatives. Investments in derivative instruments involve the risk that the Fund may be unable to sell the derivative instrument or sell it at a reasonable price. ● Management Risk The Adviser employs systematic modeling to make investment decisions about the attractiveness value and potential positive or negative performance of the Fund. The models employed by the Adviser may prove to be inaccurate and may not produce the desired results. ● Non Diversification Risk The Fund is a non diversified investment company which means that more of the Fund’s assets may be invested in the securities of a single issuer than could be invested in the securities of a single issuer by a diversified investment company. The Fund has a greater potential to realize losses upon the occurrence of adverse events affecting a particular issuer. ● OTC Trading Risk Certain of the derivatives in which the Fund may invest may be traded (and privately negotiated) in the “over the counter” or “OTC” market. While the OTC derivatives market is the primary trading venue for many derivatives it is largely unregulated. As a result and similar to other privately negotiated contracts the Fund is subject to counterparty credit risk with respect to such derivative contracts. ● Portfolio Turnover Risk The Fund may frequently buy and sell portfolio securities and other assets to rebalance the Fund’s exposure to various market sectors. Higher portfolio turnover may result in the Fund paying higher levels of transaction costs and generating greater tax liabilities for shareholders. Portfolio turnover risk may cause the Fund’s performance to be less than you expect. ● Regulatory Risk Governments agencies or other regulatory bodies may adopt or change laws or regulations that could adversely affect the issuer or market value of an instrument held by the Fund or its Subsidiary or that could adversely impact the Fund’s performance. ● Short Sales Risk The Fund may take a short position in a derivative instrument such as a future or forward or swap or a security. A short position on a derivative instrument or security involves the risk of a theoretically unlimited increase in the value of the underlying instrument. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. ● Strategy Risk The profitability of any Fund investment depends primarily on the ability of the Adviser to anticipate price movements in the relevant markets and underlying derivative instruments and futures contracts. Such price movements may be influenced by among other things ● changes in interest rates ● governmental agricultural trade fiscal monetary and exchange control programs and policies ● weather and climate conditions ● natural disasters such as hurricanes ● changing supply and demand relationships ● changes in balances of payments and trade ● U.S. and international rates of inflation and deflation ● currency devaluations and revaluations ● U.S. and international political and economic events and ● changes in philosophies and emotions of various market participants. The Fund may not take all of these factors into account. 7 ● Subsidiary Risk By investing in the Subsidiary the Fund is indirectly exposed to the risks associated with the Subsidiary’s investments. The derivatives and other investments held by the Subsidiary are generally similar to those that are permitted to be held by the Fund and are subject to the same risks that apply to similar investments if held directly by the Fund. The Subsidiary is not registered under the 1940 Act and unless otherwise noted in this Prospectus is not subject to all the investor protections of the 1940 Act. Changes in the laws or acts of the United States and or the Cayman Islands could result in the inability of the Fund and or the Subsidiary to continue to operate as it does currently and could adversely affect the Fund. ● Tax Risk In order to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) the Fund must meet certain requirements regarding the source of its income the diversification of its assets and the distribution of its income. Under the test regarding the source of a RIC’s income at least 90 of the gross income of the RIC each year must be qualifying income which consists of dividends interest gains on investment assets and other categories of investment income. In 2006 the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) published a ruling that income realized from swaps with respect to a commodities index would not be qualifying income. The Fund’s investment in the Subsidiary is expected to provide the Fund with exposure to the commodities markets within the limitations of the Code for qualification as a RIC but there is a risk that the IRS could assert that the income derived from the Fund’s investment in the Subsidiary and certain commodity linked structured notes will not be considered qualifying income for purposes of the Fund remaining qualified as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS has finalized Treasury Regulations that provide that the income from a foreign subsidiary that is a controlled foreign corporation is qualifying income for purposes of a fund remaining qualified as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes (1) to the extent the income is actually distributed by the foreign subsidiary to the RIC each year and (2) even if not distributed currently to the extent the income is derived with respect to the fund’s business of investing in stock securities or currencies. If the Fund were to fail to qualify as a RIC and became subject to federal income tax shareholders of the Fund would be subject to diminished returns. Changes in the laws or acts of the United States and or the Cayman Islands could result in the inability of the Fund and or its Subsidiary to operate as described in this Prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”) and could adversely affect the Fund. For example the Cayman Islands does not currently impose any income corporate or capital gains tax or withholding tax on the Subsidiary. If Cayman Islands acts change such that the Subsidiary must pay Cayman Islands taxes Fund shareholders would likely suffer decreased investment returns.'}, 18: {'mutual_fund_name': 'FREE MARKET INTERNATIONAL EQUITY FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The Free Market U.S. Equity Fund (for this section only the “Fund”) seeks long term capital appreciation.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 of its net assets including any borrowings for investment purposes in shares of registered open end investment companies and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) (collectively “investment companies”) that have either adopted policies to invest at least 80 of their assets in equity securities such as common stocks preferred stocks or securities convertible into stocks of U.S. companies or invest substantially all of their assets in such equity securities. The Fund will diversify its investments by investing primarily in investment companies focusing on different segments of the equity markets including large (“large cap”) small (“small cap”) and micro capitalization (“micro cap”) equity securities that the Fund’s investment adviser Matson Money Inc. (the “Adviser”) believes offer the prospect of long term capital appreciation. The purchase of shares of investment companies may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Under normal market conditions the Adviser expects substantially all of the Fund’s net assets to be invested in the securities of investment companies that invest in the types of securities described in each asset class below with less than 2 of the net assets invested in cash or money market instruments. U.S. Large Cap Value Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase common stocks and other equity securities of large cap companies that the underlying investment adviser(s) determine to be value stocks at the time of purchase. An issuer’s securities are considered value stocks primarily because they have a low price in relation to their book value. In assessing value the underlying investment adviser(s) may consider additional factors such as price to cash flow or price to earnings ratios. The criteria used for assessing value are subject to change from time to time. Large cap companies are generally considered companies whose market capitalizations are generally in the highest 90 of total market capitalization or companies whose market capitalizations are larger than or equal to the 1 000th largest U.S. company whichever results in the higher market capitalization break. Total market capitalization is based on the market capitalization of U.S. operating companies listed on a securities exchange in the United States that is deemed appropriate by the underlying investment adviser(s). The dollar amount will change from time to time due to market conditions. U.S. Small Cap Value Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase common stocks and other equity securities of small cap companies that the underlying investment adviser(s) determine to be value stocks at the time of purchase. An issuer’s securities are considered value stocks primarily because they have a low price in relation to their book value. In assessing value the underlying investment adviser(s) may consider additional factors such as price to cash flow or price to earnings ratios. The criteria used for assessing value are subject to change from time to time. Small cap companies are generally considered companies whose market capitalizations are generally in the lowest 10 of total market capitalization or companies whose market capitalizations are smaller than the 1 000th largest U.S. company whichever results in the higher market capitalization break. Total market capitalization is based on the market capitalization of U.S. operating companies listed on a securities exchange in the United States that is deemed appropriate by the underlying investment adviser(s). The dollar amount will change from time to time due to market conditions. U.S. Large Company Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase all of the stocks that comprise the S P 500® Index in approximately the proportions they are represented in the S P 500® Index. Generally these are the U.S. stocks with the largest market capitalizations and as a group they represent approximately 80 of the total market capitalization of all publicly traded U.S. stocks. U.S. Small Cap Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase common stocks and other equity securities of small cap companies primarily based on market capitalization. Small cap companies are generally considered companies whose market capitalizations are generally in the lowest 10 of total market capitalization or companies whose market capitalizations are smaller than the 1 000th largest U.S. company whichever results in the higher market capitalization break. Total market capitalization is based on the market capitalization of U.S. operating companies listed on a securities exchange in the United States that is deemed appropriate by the underlying investment adviser(s). The dollar amount will change from time to time due to market conditions. There may be some overlap in the companies in which the U.S. small cap asset class and the U.S. micro cap asset class invest. 2 U.S. Micro Cap Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase common stocks and other equity securities of micro cap companies. Micro cap companies are generally considered companies whose market capitalizations are generally in the lowest 5 of total market capitalization or companies whose market capitalizations are smaller than the 1 500th largest U.S. company whichever results in the higher market capitalization break. Total market capitalization is based on the market capitalization of U.S. operating companies listed on a securities exchange in the United States that is deemed appropriate by the underlying investment adviser(s). The dollar amount will change from time to time due to market conditions. There may be some overlap in the companies in which the U.S. micro cap asset class and the U.S. small cap asset class invest. The underlying investment companies may use derivatives such as futures contracts and options on futures contracts for U.S. equity securities and indices to adjust market exposure based on actual or expected cash inflows to or outflows from the underlying investment company. Underlying index based ETFs may use derivatives including futures contracts options on futures contracts options and swaps to help the ETF track its underlying index. The Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and money market instruments such as U.S. government securities bank obligations and commercial paper. To the extent the Fund employs a temporary defensive measure the Fund may not achieve its investment objective. Periodically the Adviser will review the allocations for the Fund in each underlying investment company and may add or remove underlying investment companies and or change the investment allocation percentages of the Fund in the underlying investment companies without notice to shareholders.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● Stocks of large cap small cap or micro cap companies in which the Fund’s underlying investment companies invest or in which the Fund invests directly may temporarily fall out of favor with investors or may be more volatile than the rest of the U.S. market as a whole. ● The smaller the capitalization of a company generally the less liquid its stock and the more volatile its price. Companies with smaller market capitalizations also tend to have unproven track records and are more likely to fail than companies with larger market capitalizations. ● Although the Fund will invest in other investment companies that follow a value oriented strategy value stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and such a strategy may cause the Fund at times to underperform equity funds that use other investment strategies. Value stocks can react differently to political economic and industry developments than the market as a whole and other types of stocks and may underperform the market for long periods of time. ● The Fund will invest in underlying investment companies that purchase stocks with high relative profitability. High relative profitability stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and an investment strategy purchasing these securities may cause the Fund to at times underperform equity funds that use other investment strategies. ● Companies in which the Fund’s underlying investment companies invest may suffer unexpected losses or lower than expected earnings or their securities may become difficult or impossible to sell at the time and for the price that the underlying investment adviser(s) would like. ● The Adviser’s judgment about the attractiveness or potential appreciation of a particular underlying investment company security could prove to be wrong or the Fund could miss out on an investment opportunity because the assets necessary to take advantage of such opportunity are tied up in less advantageous investments. 3 ● Because under normal circumstances the Fund invests at least 80 of its net assets in shares of registered investment companies that emphasize investments in U.S. equity securities the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund will change with changes in the share prices of the investment companies in which the Fund invests. ● There is a risk that large small or micro capitalization stocks may not perform as well as other asset classes or the U.S. stock market as a whole. In the past large small and micro capitalization stocks have gone through cycles of doing better or worse than the stock market in general. ● There is a risk that the Fund which is passively managed may not perform as well as funds with more active methods of investment management such as selecting securities based on economic financial and market analysis. ● The derivative instruments in which the underlying investment companies may invest are subject to a number of risks including liquidity interest rate market credit and management risks and the risk of improper valuation. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index and it is possible to lose more than the principal amount invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. ● The performance of the Fund will depend on how successfully the investment adviser(s) to the underlying investment companies pursue their investment strategies. ● ETFs are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their NAV. ● Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or the Adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● In October 2020 the SEC adopted certain regulatory changes and took other actions related to the ability of an investment company to invest in another investment company. These regulatory changes may adversely impact the Fund’s investment strategies and operations.

International Large Cap Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase the stocks and other equity securities directly or through sponsored or unsponsored depositary receipts of large companies in foreign countries with developed markets. The underlying investment adviser(s) determine the minimum market capitalization of a large company with respect to each country or region. The threshold will vary by country or region and the dollar amount will change from time to time due to market conditions. 8 Emerging Markets Asset Class Emerging Markets Value Asset Class and Emerging Markets Small Cap Asset Class (collectively the “Emerging Markets Asset Classes”) Underlying investment companies comprising each Emerging Markets Asset Class generally will purchase stocks and other equity securities directly or through sponsored or unsponsored depositary receipts of companies located in emerging market countries including frontier markets (emerging market countries in an earlier stage of development). The underlying investment companies investing in securities of the Emerging Markets Asset Class and the Emerging Markets Small Cap Asset Class will generally purchase the equity securities of larger and smaller companies respectively within each country. The underlying investment adviser(s) determine company size primarily based on market capitalization. The thresholds will vary by country or region and the dollar amounts will change from time to time due to market conditions. The underlying investment companies in the Emerging Markets Value Asset Class generally will purchase emerging market equity securities that are deemed by the underlying investment adviser(s) to be value stocks at the time of purchase. An issuer’s securities are considered value stocks primarily because they have a low price in relation to their book value. In assessing value the underlying investment adviser(s) may consider additional factors such as price to cash flow or price to earnings ratios. The criteria used for assessing value are subject to change from time to time. The underlying investment companies may use derivatives such as futures contracts and options on futures contracts for equity securities and indices to hedge currency exposure or to adjust market exposure based on actual or expected cash inflows or outflows from the underlying investment company. Underlying index based ETFs may use derivatives including futures contracts options on futures contracts forward currency contracts options and swaps to help the ETF track its underlying index. The Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and money market instruments such as U.S. government securities bank obligations and commercial paper. To the extent the Fund employs a temporary defensive measure the Fund may not achieve its investment objective. Periodically the Adviser will review the allocations for the Fund in each underlying investment company and may add or remove underlying investment companies and or change the investment allocation percentages of the Fund in the underlying investment companies without notice to shareholders.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● The value of particular foreign equity securities which the Fund’s underlying investment companies may purchase or foreign stock markets on which the securities they may purchase are traded may decline in value. ● Stocks of large cap or small cap foreign companies in which the Fund’s underlying investment companies may invest may temporarily fall out of favor with investors or may be more volatile than particular foreign stock markets or foreign stock markets as a whole. ● The smaller the capitalization of a company generally the less liquid its stock and the more volatile its price. Companies with smaller market capitalizations also tend to have unproven track records and are more likely to fail than companies with larger market capitalizations. ● Stocks of large cap or small cap foreign companies in which the Fund’s underlying investment companies may invest may suffer unexpected losses or lower than expected earnings or such securities may become difficult or impossible to sell at the time and for the price the underlying investment advisers would like. 9 ● Although the Fund will invest in other investment companies that follow a value oriented strategy value stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and such a strategy may cause the Fund at times to underperform equity funds that use other investment strategies. Value stocks can react differently to political economic and industry developments than the market as a whole and other types of stocks and may underperform the market for long periods of time. ● The Fund will invest in underlying investment companies that purchase stocks with high relative profitability. High relative profitability stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and an investment strategy purchasing these securities may cause the Fund to at times underperform equity funds that use other investment strategies. ● Because the Fund owns shares of underlying investment companies that invest in foreign issuers the Fund is subject to risks presented by investments in such issuers. Securities of foreign issuers may be negatively affected by political events economic conditions or inefficient illiquid or unregulated markets in foreign countries. Foreign issuers may be subject to inadequate regulatory or accounting standards. In addition foreign securities in which the underlying investment companies invest may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the underlying investment companies do not calculate their net asset value (“NAV”). As a result the value of the underlying investment companies’ holdings and therefore the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. ● Investments in emerging market securities by underlying investment companies in which the Fund invests are subject to higher risks than those in developed market countries because there is greater uncertainty in less established markets and economics. The foregoing risks may be greater in frontier markets which are among the smallest and least mature investment markets. ● Currency risk is the risk that exchange rates for currencies in which securities held by the underlying investment companies in which the Fund invests are denominated will fluctuate daily. In general the underlying investment companies do not hedge currency risk. As a result if currencies in which foreign holdings are denominated depreciate against the U.S. Dollar the value of your investment in the Fund may be adversely affected. ● ETFs are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their NAV. ● Investments in depositary receipts by underlying investment companies in which the Fund invests are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted. In addition the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts particularly unsponsored or unregistered depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications to the holders of such receipts or to pass through to them any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities. Depositary receipts that are not sponsored by the issuer may be less liquid and there may be less readily available public information about the issuer. ● The Adviser’s judgment about the attractiveness or potential appreciation of a particular underlying investment company security could prove to be wrong or the Fund could miss out on an investment opportunity because the assets necessary to take advantage of such opportunity are tied up in less advantageous investments. 10 ● Because under normal circumstances the Fund invests at least 80 of its net assets in shares of registered investment companies that emphasize investments in equity securities of foreign companies the NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the share prices of the investment companies in which the Fund invests. ● There is a risk that the Fund which is passively managed may not perform as well as funds with more active methods of investment management such as selecting securities based on economic financial and market analysis. ● The derivative instruments in which the underlying investment companies may invest are subject to a number of risks including liquidity interest rate market credit and management risks and the risk of improper valuation. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index and it is possible to lose more than the principal amount invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. ● The performance of the Fund will depend on how successfully the investment adviser(s) to the underlying investment companies pursue their investment strategies. ● Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or the Adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● In October 2020 the SEC adopted certain regulatory changes and took other actions related to the ability of an investment company to invest in another investment company. These regulatory changes may adversely impact the Fund’s investment strategies and operations. More information about the Fund’s investments and risks is contained under the section entitled “More About Each Fund’s Investments and Risks.”'}, 20: {'mutual_fund_name': 'S U.S. Large Cap Equity Fund', 'investment_objective': 'The Free Market Fixed Income Fund (for this section only the “Fund”) seeks total return (consisting of current income and capital appreciation).', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 of its net assets including any borrowings for investment purposes in shares of registered open end investment companies and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) (collectively “investment companies”) that have either adopted policies to invest at least 80 of their assets in fixed income securities that the Fund’s investment adviser Matson Money Inc. (the “Adviser”) believes offer the prospect of providing total return or invest substantially all of their assets in such fixed income securities. The purchase of shares of investment companies may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Under normal market conditions the Adviser expects substantially all of the Fund’s net assets to be invested in the securities of investment companies that invest in the types of securities described in each asset class below with less than 2 of the net assets invested in cash or money market instruments. One Year Fixed Income Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase U.S. government obligations U.S. government agency obligations dollar denominated obligations of foreign issuers issued in the U.S. securities of domestic or foreign issuers denominated in U.S. dollars but not trading in the U.S. foreign government and agency obligations bank obligations including the obligations of U.S. subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks corporate obligations commercial paper repurchase agreements and obligations of supranational organizations such as the World Bank the European Investment Bank and the Inter American Development Bank. Generally obligations comprising this asset class will mature within one year from the date of settlement but substantial investments may be made in obligations maturing within two years from the date of settlement when greater returns are available. Two Year Global Fixed Income Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. and foreign governments their agencies and instrumentalities corporate debt obligations bank obligations commercial paper repurchase agreements and other debt obligations of domestic and foreign issuers with maturities of no more than two years. In making purchase decisions if the expected term premium is greater for longer term securities in the eligible maturity range the underlying investment adviser(s) will focus investment in the longer term area otherwise the underlying investment companies will focus investment in the shorter term area of the eligible maturity range. Because many of the investments of the underlying investment companies in this asset class will be denominated in foreign currencies the underlying investment companies may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to attempt to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign currency rates to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates or to transfer balances from one currency to another. Intermediate Government Fixed Income Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase debt obligations of the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies. Generally investment companies in the asset class will purchase securities with maturities of between five and fifteen years however such investment companies ordinarily will have an average weighted maturity of between three and ten years. The underlying investment companies may invest a portion of their assets in the obligations of foreign governments. Those obligations at the time of purchase must be either rated in the highest rating category of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or in the case of any obligation that is unrated of comparable quality. 15 Five Year Global Fixed Income Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. and foreign governments their agencies and instrumentalities corporate debt obligations bank obligations commercial paper repurchase agreements obligations of other domestic and foreign issuers securities of domestic or foreign issuers denominated in U.S. dollars but not trading in the United States and obligations of supranational organizations. Generally obligations comprising this asset class have a weighted average maturity not exceeding five years. In making purchase decisions if the expected term premium is greater for longer term securities in the eligible maturity range the underlying investment adviser(s) will focus investment in the longer term area otherwise the underlying investment companies will focus investment in the shorter term area of the eligible maturity range. Because many of the investments of the underlying investment companies in this asset class will be denominated in foreign currencies the underlying investment companies may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to attempt to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign currency rates to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates or to transfer balances from one currency to another. Short Term Corporate Bond Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will track the investment results of the ICE BofAML 1 5 Year US Corporate Index which measures the performance of investment grade corporate bonds of both U.S. and non U.S. issuers that are U.S. dollar denominated and publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market and have a remaining maturity of greater than or equal to one year and less than five years. Intermediate Term Corporate Bond Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will track the investment results of the ICE BofAML 5 10 Year US Corporate Index which measures the performance of investment grade corporate bonds of both U.S. and non U.S. issuers that are U.S. dollar denominated and publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market and have a remaining maturity of greater than or equal to five years and less than ten years. Inflation Protected Securities Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will track the investment results of the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) Index (Series L) which measures the performance of the inflation protected public obligations of the U.S. Treasury commonly known as “TIPS.” TIPS are securities issued by the U.S. Treasury that are designed to provide inflation protection to investors. TIPS are income generating instruments whose interest and principal payments are adjusted for inflation a sustained increase in prices that erodes the purchasing power of money. The inflation adjustment which is typically applied monthly to the principal of the bond follows a designated inflation index the consumer price index (“CPI”) and TIPS’ principal payments are adjusted according to changes in the CPI. A fixed coupon rate is applied to the inflation adjusted principal so that as inflation rises both the principal value and the interest payments increase. The underlying investment companies may also use derivatives such as futures contracts and options on futures contracts for equity securities and indices to hedge currency exposure or to adjust market exposure based on actual or expected cash inflows or outflows from the underlying investment company. Underlying index based ETFs may use derivatives including futures contracts options on futures contracts forward currency contracts options and swaps to help the ETF track its underlying index. Certain underlying investment companies may concentrate their investments (invest more than 25 of its total assets) in obligations of U.S. and foreign banks and bank holding companies when the yield to maturity on eligible portfolio investments in banking securities as a group generally exceeds the yield to maturity on all other eligible portfolio investments as a group generally for a period of five consecutive days when the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. While the Fund will not concentrate its investments in any one industry the Fund may be focused on banking sectors under certain circumstances. The Fund reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and money market instruments such as U.S. government securities bank obligations and commercial paper. To the extent the Fund employs a temporary defensive measure the Fund may not achieve its investment objective. Periodically the Adviser will review the allocations for the Fund in each underlying investment company and may add or remove underlying investment companies and or change the investment allocation percentages of the Fund in the underlying investment companies without notice to shareholders.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Fund as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Fund regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● Fixed income securities in which the Fund’s underlying investment companies may invest are subject to certain risks including interest rate risk reinvestment risk prepayment and extension risk credit default risk and the risks associated with investing in repurchase agreements. ● Interest rate risk involves the risk that prices of fixed income securities will rise and fall in response to interest rate changes. ● Reinvestment risk involves the risk that proceeds from matured investments may be re invested at lower interest rates. ● Prepayment risk involves the risk that in declining interest rates environments prepayments of principal could increase and require the Fund to reinvest proceeds of the prepayments at lower interest rates. ● Extension risk involves the risk that prepayments of principal will decrease when interest rates rise resulting in a longer effective maturity of a security. ● Credit risk is the risk that the issuer of a security may be unable to make interest payments and or repay principal when due. Credit risk also involves the risk that the credit rating of a security may be lowered. ● Repurchase agreement risk involves the risk that the other party to a repurchase agreement will be unable to complete the transaction and the underlying investment company in which the Fund invests may suffer a loss as a result. ● Because the Fund owns shares of underlying investment companies that invest in foreign issuers the Fund is subject to risks presented by investments in such issuers. Securities of foreign issuers may be negatively affected by political events economic conditions or inefficient illiquid or unregulated markets in foreign countries. Foreign issuers may be subject to inadequate regulatory or accounting standards. In addition foreign securities in which the underlying investment companies invest may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the underlying investment companies do not calculate their net asset value (“NAV”). As a result the value of the underlying investment companies’ holdings and therefore the Fund’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Fund’s shares. ● Currency risk is the risk that exchange rates for currencies in which securities held by the underlying investment companies in which the Fund invests are denominated will fluctuate daily. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts may limit potential gains from a favorable change in value between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. Unanticipated changes in currency pricing may result in poorer overall performance for the Fund than if it had not engaged in these contracts. 17 ● ETFs are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. The Fund may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Fund’s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their NAV. ● Inflation protected securities such as TIPS generally will fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates generally decreasing when real interest rates rise and increasing when real interest rates fall. In addition interest payments on inflation protected securities will generally vary up or down along with the rate of inflation. Real interest rates are generally measured as a nominal interest less an inflation rate. As such investors should be aware that an investment in TIPS over a particular timeframe may decrease in value even in an inflationary environment. There can be no assurance that the inflation index used will accurately measure the real rate of inflation in the prices of goods and services. Because of their inflation adjustment feature inflation protected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixed rate bonds. ● The Adviser’s judgment about the attractiveness or potential appreciation of a particular underlying investment company security could prove to be wrong or the Fund could miss out on an investment opportunity because the assets necessary to take advantage of such opportunity are tied up in less advantageous investments. ● Because under normal circumstances the Fund invests at least 80 of its net assets in shares of registered investment companies that emphasize investments in fixed income securities the NAV of the Fund will change with changes in the share prices of the investment companies in which the Fund invests. ● Not all obligations of U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. Some are backed only by the credit of the issuing agency or instrumentality. Accordingly there may be some risk of default by the issuer in such cases. ● There is a risk that the Fund which is passively managed may not perform as well as funds with more active methods of investment management such as selecting securities based on economic financial and market analysis. ● The derivative instruments in which the underlying investment companies may invest are subject to a number of risks including liquidity interest rate market credit and management risks and the risk of improper valuation. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index and it is possible to lose more than the principal amount invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. ● The performance of the Fund will depend on how successfully the investment adviser(s) to the underlying investment companies pursue their investment strategies. ● Banks are very sensitive to changes in money market and general economic conditions. Adverse general economic conditions can cause financial difficulties for a bank’s borrowers and the borrowers’ failure to repay their loans can adversely affect the bank’s financial situation. Banks are subject to extensive regulation and decisions by regulators may limit the loans banks make and the interest rates and fees they charge which could reduce bank profitability. 18 ● Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Fund assets Fund or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Fund the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Fund investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Fund and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Fund or the Adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Fund or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Fund or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● In October 2020 the SEC adopted certain regulatory changes and took other actions related to the ability of an investment company to invest in another investment company.

U.S. Large Company Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase all of the stocks that comprise the S P 500® Index in approximately the proportions they are represented in the S P 500® Index. Generally these are the U.S. stocks with the largest market capitalizations and as a group they represent approximately 80 of the total market capitalization of all publicly traded U.S. stocks. 2 U.S. Small Cap Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase common stocks and other equity securities of small cap companies primarily based on market capitalization.

The Portfolio will diversify its investments by investing primarily in investment companies that focus on different segments of the foreign equity markets including emerging markets with little or no focus on domestic equity markets. The purchase of shares of investment companies may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Portfolio’s own expenses. Under normal market conditions the Portfolio’s investment adviser Matson Money Inc. (the “Adviser”) expects substantially all of the Portfolio’s net assets to be invested in the securities of investment companies including other investment companies funded by insurance company separate accounts that invest in the types of securities described in each asset class below with less than 5 of the net assets invested in cash or money market instruments. International Small Cap Value Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase the stocks and other equity securities directly or through sponsored or unsponsored depositary receipts of small companies in foreign countries with developed markets that the underlying investment adviser(s) determine to be value stocks at the time of purchase. An issuer’s securities are considered value stocks primarily because they have a low price in relation to their book value. In assessing value the underlying investment adviser(s) may consider additional factors such as price to cash flow or price to earnings ratios as well as economic conditions and developments in the issuer’s industry. The criteria used for assessing value are subject to change from time to time. The underlying investment adviser(s) determine the maximum market capitalization of a small company with respect to each country. The threshold will vary by country or region and the dollar amount will change from time to time due to market conditions. International Large Cap Value Asset Class The underlying investment companies generally will purchase the stocks and other equity securities directly or through sponsored or unsponsored depositary receipts of large companies in foreign countries with developed markets that the underlying investment adviser(s) determine to be value stocks at the time of purchase. An issuer’s securities are considered value stocks primarily because they have a low price in relation to their book value.

The underlying investment companies investing in securities of the Emerging Markets Asset Class and the Emerging Markets Small Cap Asset Class will generally purchase the equity securities of larger and smaller companies respectively within each country. The underlying investment adviser(s) determine company size primarily based on market capitalization. The thresholds will vary by country or region and the dollar amounts will change from time to time due to market conditions. The underlying investment companies in the Emerging Markets Value Asset Class generally will purchase emerging market equity securities that are deemed by the underlying investment adviser(s) to be value stocks at the time of purchase. An issuer’s securities are considered value stocks primarily because they have a low price in relation to their book value. In assessing value the underlying investment adviser(s) may consider additional factors such as price to cash flow or price to earnings ratios. The criteria used for assessing value are subject to change from time to time. The underlying investment companies may use derivatives such as futures contracts and options on futures contracts for equity securities and indices to hedge currency exposure or to adjust market exposure based on actual or expected cash inflows or outflows from the underlying investment company. Underlying index based ETFs may use derivatives including futures contracts options on futures contracts forward currency contracts options and swaps to help the ETF track its underlying index. The Portfolio reserves the right to hold up to 100 of its assets as a temporary defensive measure in cash and money market instruments such as U.S. government securities bank obligations and commercial paper. To the extent the Portfolio employs a temporary defensive measure the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Periodically the Adviser will review the allocations for the Portfolio in each underlying investment company and may add or remove underlying investment companies and or change the investment allocation percentages of the Portfolio in the underlying investment companies without notice to shareholders or the holders of the variable annuity or variable life insurance policies.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your investment in the Portfolio as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Portfolio or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. Each risk summarized below is considered a “principal risk” of investing in the Portfolio regardless of the order in which it appears. Different risks may be more significant at different times depending on market conditions or other factors. ● The value of particular foreign equity securities which the Portfolio’s underlying investment companies may purchase or foreign stock markets on which the securities they may purchase are traded may decline in value. ● Stocks of large cap or small cap foreign companies in which the Portfolio’s underlying investment companies may invest may temporarily fall out of favor with investors or may be more volatile than particular foreign stock markets or foreign stock markets as a whole. ● The smaller the capitalization of a company generally the less liquid its stock and the more volatile its price. Companies with smaller market capitalizations also tend to have unproven track records and are more likely to fail than companies with larger market capitalizations. ● Stocks of large cap or small cap foreign companies in which the Portfolio’s underlying investment companies may invest may suffer unexpected losses or lower than expected earnings or such securities may become difficult or impossible to sell at the time and for the price the underlying investment advisers would like. 10 ● Although the Portfolio will invest in other investment companies that follow a value oriented strategy value stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and such a strategy may cause the Portfolio at times to underperform equity funds that use other investment strategies. Value stocks can react differently to political economic and industry developments than the market as a whole and other types of stocks and may underperform the market for long periods of time. ● The Portfolio will invest in underlying investment companies that purchase stocks with high relative profitability. High relative profitability stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and an investment strategy purchasing these securities may cause the Portfolio to at times underperform equity funds that use other investment strategies. ● Because the Portfolio owns shares of underlying investment companies that invest in foreign issuers the Portfolio is subject to risks presented by investments in such issuers. Securities of foreign issuers may be negatively affected by political events economic conditions or inefficient illiquid or unregulated markets in foreign countries. Foreign issuers may be subject to inadequate regulatory or accounting standards. In addition foreign securities in which the underlying investment companies invest may be listed on foreign exchanges that trade on weekends or other days when the underlying investment companies do not calculate their net asset value (“NAV”). As a result the value of the underlying investment companies’ holdings and therefore the Portfolio’s holdings may change on days when shareholders are not able to purchase or redeem the Portfolio’s shares. ● Investments in emerging market securities by underlying investment companies in which the Portfolio invests are subject to higher risks than those in developed market countries because there is greater uncertainty in less established markets and economics. The foregoing risks may be greater in frontier markets which are among the smallest and least mature investment markets. ● Currency risk is the risk that exchange rates for currencies in which securities held by the underlying investment companies in which the Portfolio invests are denominated will fluctuate daily. In general the underlying investment companies do not hedge currency risk. As a result if currencies in which foreign holdings are denominated depreciate against the U.S. Dollar the value of your investment in the Portfolio may be adversely affected. ● Investments in depositary receipts by underlying investment companies in which the Portfolio invests are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted. In addition the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts particularly unsponsored or unregistered depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications to the holders of such receipts or to pass through to them any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities. Depositary receipts that are not sponsored by the issuer may be less liquid and there may be less readily available public information about the issuer. ● The Adviser’s judgment about the attractiveness or potential appreciation of a particular underlying investment company security could prove to be wrong or the Portfolio could miss out on an investment opportunity because the assets necessary to take advantage of such opportunity are tied up in less advantageous investments. ● Because under normal circumstances the Portfolio invests at least 80 of its net assets in shares of registered investment companies that emphasize investments in equity securities of foreign companies the NAV of the Portfolio will change with changes in the share prices of the investment companies in which the Portfolio invests. ● There is a risk that the Portfolio which is passively managed may not perform as well as funds with more active methods of investment management such as selecting securities based on economic financial and market analysis. 11 ● The derivative instruments in which the underlying investment companies may invest are subject to a number of risks including liquidity interest rate market credit and management risks and the risk of improper valuation. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index and it is possible to lose more than the principal amount invested. The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments. ● The performance of the Portfolio will depend on how successfully the investment adviser(s) to the underlying investment companies pursue their investment strategies. ● ETFs are a type of investment company bought and sold on a securities exchange. An ETF typically represents a fixed portfolio of securities designed to track a particular market index. The risks of owning an ETF generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities that they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an ETF could result in its being more volatile. Some ETFs are actively managed by an investment adviser and or sub advisers. Actively managed ETFs are subject to the risk of poor investment selection. the Portfolio may incur brokerage fees in connection with its purchase of ETF shares. The purchase of shares of ETFs may result in duplication of expenses including advisory fees in addition to the Portfolio’s own expenses. Certain ETFs may be thinly traded and experience large spreads between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. The existence of extreme market volatility or potential lack of an active trading market for an ETF’s shares could result in such shares trading at a significant premium or discount to their NAV. ● Cyber security risk is the risk of an unauthorized breach and access to Portfolio assets Portfolio or customer data (including private shareholder information) or proprietary information or the risk of an incident occurring that causes the Portfolio the investment adviser custodian transfer agent distributor and other service providers and financial intermediaries to suffer data breaches data corruption or lose operational functionality or prevent Portfolio investors from purchasing redeeming or exchanging shares or receiving distributions. The Portfolio and its investment adviser have limited ability to prevent or mitigate cyber security incidents affecting third party service providers and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to the Portfolio or the Adviser. Successful cyber attacks or other cyber failures or events affecting the Portfolio or its service providers may adversely impact and cause financial losses to the Portfolio or its shareholders. Issuers of securities in which the Portfolio invests are also subject to cyber security risks and the value of these securities could decline if the issuers experience cyber attacks or other cyber failures. ● In October 2020 the SEC adopted certain regulatory changes and took other actions related to the ability of an investment company to invest in another investment company. These regulatory changes may adversely impact the Portfolio’s investment strategies and operations.

Domestic securities include companies that are incorporated or headquartered in the U.S. Such securities may be issued by domestic or foreign issuers. The Fund may invest in the securities of foreign issuers both directly and in the form of depository receipts including both sponsored and unsponsored American Depository Receipts (“ADRs”) and Global Depository Receipts (“GDRs”) each of which represent an interest in foreign securities. Securities of foreign issuers or foreign securities include companies that are neither incorporated nor headquartered in the U.S. The Fund primarily seeks to buy common stock and may also invest in preferred stock. The Fund may also invest in large cap and small cap publicly traded equity securities. From time to time the Fund may invest in shares of companies through “new issues” or initial public offerings (“IPOs”). Subject to applicable statutory and regulatory limitations the Fund may invest in shares of other investment companies consisting of mutual funds and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”). The Fund may also purchase other securities with equity characteristics including securities convertible into common stock. Brown Brothers Harriman Co. (“BBH Co.”) through a separately identifiable department (“Investment Adviser”) considers mid cap securities to be securities that at the time of purchase have a market capitalization within the range of companies 5 included in the Russell Midcap Index. As of January 31 2022 the market capitalization range of companies included in the Russell Midcap Index was 720.0 million to 62.3 billion. The Fund’s strategy is based on fundamental business analysis and a long term orientation. The Investment Adviser selects companies based on their qualitative merits competitive profile and prospective value creation potential. As part of the Fund’s investment process the Investment Adviser considers environmental social and governance (“ESG”) factors for each investment in the portfolio. ESG factors include but are not limited to the environmental and social impact of the issuer as well as the issuer’s instituted governance programs. The Fund follows a “buy and own” approach that does not make use of short term trades in pursuit of small gains. The Investment Adviser believes that its long term orientation can benefit the Fund’s net performance results. Investments may be sold if they appreciate to levels at or near the higher end of the Investment Adviser’s estimated ranges of intrinsic value. The Fund is non diversified and may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer than would a diversified fund.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'The principal risks of investing in the Fund and the circumstances reasonably likely to adversely affect an investment are listed and described below. The share price of the Fund changes daily based on market conditions and other factors. A shareholder may lose money by investing 6 in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Mid Cap Company Risk Mid cap companies when compared to larger companies may experience lower trade volume and could be subject to greater and less predictable price changes. Mid cap companies may also have limited management experience or depth limited ability to generate or borrow capital needed for growth limited products or services or operate in less established markets. Therefore mid cap securities may be subject to changing economic market and industry conditions and experience more volatility and less liquidity over short periods. Investment Risk Investors in the Fund could lose money including the possible loss of the entire principal amount of an investment over short or long periods of time. Market Risk The price of a security may fall due to changing economic political regulatory or market conditions or due to a company’s or issuer’s individual situation. Natural disasters the spread of infectious illness and other public health emergencies recession terrorism and other unforeseeable events may lead to increased market volatility and may have adverse effects on world economies and markets generally. Equity Securities Risk Equity securities risk is the risk that prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. Price movements may occur due to factors affecting individual companies such as the issuance of an unfavorable earnings report or other events affecting particular industries or the equity market as a whole. 7 Non Diversification Risk Because a non diversified fund under the federal securities laws may invest in a relatively small number of issuers compared to a diversified fund changes in the financial condition of individual issuers as well as political regulatory or economic occurrences affecting such issuers may cause greater fluctuation in the value of a non diversified fund’s shares. However the Fund intends to satisfy the asset diversification requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company (a “RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the “Code”). Large Shareholder Risk Asset allocation decisions particularly large redemptions made by an investor or an investment adviser whose discretionary clients make up a large percentage of the Fund’s shareholders may adversely impact remaining Fund shareholders. Management Risk The Fund is actively managed and its success depends upon the investment skills and analytical abilities of the Investment Adviser to develop and effectively implement strategies that achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Subjective decisions made by the Investment Adviser may cause the Fund to incur losses or to miss profit opportunities on which it may otherwise have capitalized. 8 Large Cap Company Risk Because the Fund may invest in large cap company securities it may underperform other funds during periods when the Fund’s large cap securities are out of favor. Small Cap Company Risk Small cap companies may have limited product lines or markets. They may be less financially secure than larger more established companies and may depend on a more limited management group than larger capitalized companies. Foreign Investment Risk Investing in securities of foreign based companies including sponsored and unsponsored ADRs and GDRs involves risks not typically associated with investing in securities of companies organized and operated in the United States. These risks include adverse political social and economic developments abroad different kinds and levels of market and issuer regulations and the different characteristics of overseas economies and markets. These factors can make foreign investments more volatile and potentially less liquid than U.S. investments. Additionally investments in foreign securities may be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar which are subject to changes in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could offset investment gains or add to investment losses. Unsponsored ADRs do not trade on an exchange and therefore may be difficult to sell and investors do not have the benefits and voting rights that are extended to other shareholders. Investment in Other Investment Companies Risk Investments in other investment companies are subject to market and selection risk as well as the specific risks associated with the investment companies portfolio securities. As a shareholder of another investment company the Fund would bear along with other shareholders its pro rata portion of the other investment company s expenses including advisory fees. 9 The shares of an investment company that trade on an exchange (for example an ETF) may trade below their net asset value or at a discount which may adversely affect the Fund s performance. IPO Risk IPOs are new issues of equity securities. Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods. In addition the prices of securities sold in IPOs may be highly volatile or may decline shortly after the IPO. Preferred Securities Risk The Fund may invest in preferred securities which are equity interests in a company that entitle the holder to receive common stock dividends and a fixed share of the proceeds resulting from a liquidation of the company in preference to the holders of other securities. Preferred securities may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return. Preferred securities are subject to issuer specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. In addition a company’s preferred securities generally pay dividends only after the company makes required payments to holders of its bonds and other debt. If a company experiences actual or perceived changes in its financial condition or prospects the value of preferred securities may be more greatly affected than the value of bonds and other debt. 10 FUND PERFORMANCE'}, 2: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BBH PARTNER FUNDINTERNATIONAL EQUITY', 'investment_objective': 'The investment objective of the BBH Partner Fund – International Equity (the “Fund”) is to provide investors with long term maximization of total return primarily through capital appreciation.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'Under normal circumstances at least 80 of the net assets of the Fund plus any borrowings for investment purposes are invested in equity securities of companies in the developed and emerging markets of the world excluding the United States. Developed markets are those markets included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International—Europe Australasia and Far East Index (“MSCI EAFE”) and Canada. The Fund may invest up to 35 of its assets at the time of purchase in emerging markets of the world. An emerging market is generally considered to be a securities market located in any country that is defined as having an emerging or developing economy by the World Bank or its related organizations or the United Nations or its authorities. The Fund will primarily invest in equity securities of companies with large market capitalizations.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'The principal risks of investing in the Fund and the circumstances reasonably likely to adversely affect an investment are listed and described below. The share price of the Fund changes daily based on market conditions and other factors. A shareholder may lose money by investing in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. 6 Equity Securities Risk Equity securities risk is the risk that prices of equity securities rise and fall daily due to factors affecting individual companies particular industries or the equity market as a whole. Market Risk The price of a security may fall due to changing economic political regulatory or market conditions or due to a company’s or issuer’s individual situation. Natural disasters the spread of infectious illness and other public health emergencies recession terrorism and other unforeseeable events may lead to increased market volatility and may have adverse effects on world economies and markets generally. Investment Risk Investors in the Fund could lose money including the possible loss of the entire principal amount of an investment over short or long periods of time. Foreign Investment Risk Investing in securities of foreign based companies involves risks not typically associated with investing in securities of companies organized and operated in the United States. These risks include adverse political social and economic developments abroad different kinds and levels of market and issuer regulations and the different characteristics of overseas economies and markets. These factors can make foreign investments more volatile and potentially less liquid than U.S. investments. Management Risk The Fund is actively managed and its success depends upon the investment skills and analytical abilities of the Sub adviser to develop and effectively implement strategies that achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Subjective decisions made by the Sub adviser may cause the Fund to incur losses or to miss profit opportunities on which it may otherwise have capitalized. 7 Currency Exchange Rate Risk Because the Fund invests in securities denominated in or providing exposure to non U.S. currencies and the Fund’s net asset value per share (“NAV”) is determined on the basis of U.S. dollars the U.S. dollar value of your investment in the Fund may go down if the value of the local currency of the non U.S. markets in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. Large Cap Company Risk Because the Fund invests in large cap company securities it may underperform other funds during periods when the Fund’s large cap securities are out of favor. Limited Portfolio Holdings Risk Although the Fund is a diversified fund and as such intends to meet the diversification requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”) the Fund may from time to time invest in a limited number of issuers. As a result the appreciation or depreciation of any one security held by the Fund will have a greater impact on the Fund’s net asset value than it would if the Fund invested in a larger number of securities. Although that strategy has the potential to generate attractive returns over time it also increases the Fund’s volatility and may lead to greater losses. Emerging Markets Risk Emerging markets involve risks greater than those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign markets. These less developed markets can be subject to 8 greater social economic regulatory and political uncertainties and can be extremely volatile. Derivatives Risk Derivatives including forwards and futures may be riskier than other types of investments and may increase the volatility of the Fund. Derivatives may be sensitive to changes in economic and market conditions and may create leverage which could result in losses that significantly exceed the Fund’s original investment. Derivatives expose the Fund to counter party risk which is the risk that the derivative counterparty will not fulfill its contractual obligations (and includes credit risk associated with the counterparty). Certain derivatives are synthetic instruments that attempt to replicate the performance of certain reference assets. With regard to such derivatives the Fund does not have a claim on the reference assets and is subject to enhanced counterparty risk. Derivatives may not perform as expected so the Fund may not realize the intended benefits. When used for hedging the change in value of a derivative may not correlate as expected with the security or other risk being hedged. In addition given their complexity derivatives expose the Fund to risks of mispricing or improper valuation. Capital Controls Risk Capital controls imposed by foreign governments in response to economic or political events may impact the ability of the Fund to buy sell or otherwise transfer securities or currency may adversely affect the trading market and price for shares of the Fund and may cause the Fund to decline in value. Large Shareholder Risk Asset allocation decisions particularly large redemptions made by BBH Co. whose discretionary investment advisory clients make up a large percentage of the Fund’s shareholders may adversely impact remaining Fund shareholders.'}, 3: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BBH PARTNER FUNDSMALL CAP EQUITY', 'investment_objective': 'The investment objective of the BBH Partner Fund—Small Cap Equity (the “Fund”) is to provide investors with long term growth of capital.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'Under normal circumstances the Fund invests at least 80 of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in small cap equity securities. Such securities will be publicly traded and issued by domestic issuers directly. The Fund primarily seeks to purchase common stock. The Fund considers small cap securities to be securities that at the time of purchase have market capitalizations between (or equal) to the largest and smallest companies within the Russell 2000 Index and or are constituents of the Russell 2000 Index as of the date of the latest reconstitution. As of January 31 2022 the market capitalization range of companies included in the Russell 2000 Index was 4 22.0 million to 10.1 billion. The Fund will concentrate at least 25 of its net assets in the Software Services Industry Group within the Information Technology Sector. Brown Brothers Harriman Co. (“BBH Co.”) through a separately identifiable department (“Investment Adviser”) employs a “manager of managers” investment approach whereby it allocates the Fund’s assets to the Fund’s sub adviser Bares Capital Management Inc. (“Sub adviser”). Subject to the general supervision by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (“Board”) the Investment Adviser oversees the Sub adviser and evaluates its performance results. The Investment Adviser reviews portfolio performance characteristics and changes in key personnel of the Sub adviser. The Sub adviser is primarily responsible for the day to day management of the Fund’s portfolio including purchases and sales of individual securities. However the Investment Adviser may when deemed appropriate manage all or a portion of the Fund’s assets according to the Fund’s principal investment strategies. The Sub adviser focuses on identifying companies that it believes are qualitatively excellent through “bottoms up” research primarily involving a review of public documents field work including company site visits industry trade shows user conferences and product demonstrations discussions with suppliers customers and competitors and other primary and secondary due diligence. The Fund will typically invest in companies with durable competitive advantages the potential for high returns on invested capital skilled shareholder friendly management teams and large growth opportunities. After qualitative assessment is complete the Sub adviser values the companies that meet its criteria using a discounted cash flow model or other relevant methods and invests in a limited number of companies that present the most compelling mix of qualitative characteristics (e.g. competitive position) and quantitative metrics (e.g. price in relation to intrinsic value). As part of the Fund’s investment process the Sub adviser considers environmental social and governance (“ESG”) factors for each investment in the portfolio. ESG factors include but are not limited to the environmental and social impact of the issuer as well as the issuer’s instituted governance programs. Investments may be sold if they appreciate to levels at or near the higher end of the Sub adviser’s estimated 5 ranges of intrinsic value. However the Fund may retain these investments if they continue to meet the Fund’s investment objective and strategy. The Fund operates as a “non diversified company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) which means that the Fund may invest a significant portion of its assets in the securities of a limited number of issuers. The Fund invests in at least 20 companies each of which must meet the Sub adviser s prescriptive fundamental criteria.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'The principal risks of investing in the Fund and the circumstances reasonably likely to adversely affect an investment are listed and described below. The share price of the Fund changes daily based on market conditions and other factors. A shareholder may lose money by investing in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Small Cap Company Risk Small cap companies when compared to larger companies may experience lower trade volume and could be subject to greater and less predictable price changes. Small cap companies may also have limited management experience or depth limited ability to generate or borrow capital needed for growth limited products or services or operate in less established markets. Therefore small cap securities may be subject to changing economic market and industry conditions and experience more volatility and less liquidity over short periods. 6 Investment Risk Investors in the Fund could lose money including the possible loss of the entire principal amount of an investment over short or long periods of time. Market Risk The price of a security may fall due to changing economic political regulatory or market conditions or due to a company’s or issuer’s individual situation. Natural disasters the spread of infectious illness and other public health emergencies recession terrorism and other unforeseeable events may lead to increased market volatility and may have adverse effects on world economies and markets generally. Equity Securities Risk Equity securities risk is the risk that prices of equity securities rise and fall daily. Price movements may occur due to factors affecting individual companies such as the issuance of an unfavorable earnings report or other events affecting particular industries or the equity market as a whole. Non Diversification Risk Because a non diversified fund under the federal securities laws may invest in a relatively small number of issuers compared to a diversified fund changes in the financial condition of individual issuers as well as political regulatory or economic occurrences affecting such issuers may cause greater fluctuation in the value of a non diversified fund’s shares. However the Fund intends to satisfy the asset diversification requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the “Code”). Software Services Industry Group Concentration Risk When a fund focuses its investments in a particular industry group of industries or sector financial economic business and other developments affecting issuers in those industries or sector will have a greater effect on the fund than if it had not done so. Market or economic factors impacting 7 companies in the information technology sector could have a major effect on the value of the Fund’s investments. Stocks of such companies especially those of smaller less seasoned companies tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Additionally companies in the information technology sector may face unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Computer software services companies can be significantly affected by competitive pressures aggressive pricing technological developments changing domestic demand the ability to attract and retain skilled employees and availability and price of components. The market for products produced by computer software services companies is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. The success of computer software services companies depends in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of new products and the ability to service such products. An unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuer’s products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could have a material adverse effect on a participant’s operating results. Some computer software services companies rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and protect their proprietary rights in their products and technologies. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by computer software services companies to protect their proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of their technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to such companies’ technology. 8 Large Shareholder Risk Asset allocation decisions particularly large redemptions made by an investor or an investment adviser whose discretionary clients make up a large percentage of the Fund’s shareholders may adversely impact remaining Fund shareholders. Management Risk The Fund is actively managed and its success depends upon the investment skills and analytical abilities of the Sub adviser to develop and effectively implement strategies that achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Subjective decisions made by the Sub adviser may cause the Fund to incur losses or to miss profit opportunities on which it may otherwise have capitalized.'}, 4: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BBH PARTNER FUNDSELECT SHORT TERM ASSETS', 'investment_objective': 'The investment objective of the BBH Partner Fund – Select Short Term Assets (the “Fund”) is to provide income balanced with low price volatility.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a well diversified portfolio of durable performing fixed income instruments.

These investments will be primarily focused in asset backed securities (“ABS”) notes and bonds issued by domestic and foreign corporations including those located in emerging markets and financial institutions and the U.S. Government government agencies and government guaranteed issuers. The Fund may purchase mortgage backed securities and sovereign debt when the investment adviser believes that the additional returns from these securities justify the risk of 4 allocations to these asset classes. Typically the duration of the Fund will be less than eighteen months. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a fixed income security to a change in interest rate. For every 1 change in interest rate a fixed income security’s price will change by 1 for every year of duration therefore the longer a security’s duration the more sensitive it is to changes in interest rates. The Fund may invest in money market instruments repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements commercial paper derivative instruments including futures swaps and options and private placement securities including Rule 144A Regulation S and Regulation D securities to meet its investment objective. The Fund may also invest a portion of its assets in securities that have characteristics of equity securities including but not limited to convertible securities and preferred stock. Subject to applicable statutory and regulatory limitations the Fund may invest in shares of other investment companies such as exchange traded funds (“ETFs”). While the assets of the Fund will be primarily invested in securities denominated in U.S. dollars some investments may be denominated in other currencies. Though the Fund primarily invests in securities rated A A and equivalent or better it may invest in lower rated securities when the investment adviser believes that the additional income from these securities justifies the higher risk.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'The principal risks of investing in the Fund and the circumstances reasonably likely to adversely affect an investment are listed and described below. The share price of the Fund changes daily based on market conditions and other factors. A shareholder may lose money by investing in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Issuer Risk The value of a security may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer such as management performance financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer’s goods or services. 5 Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the likelihood that an issuer guarantor or the counterparty to a derivative contract or repurchase agreement will default on interest or principal payments. For ABS and commercial mortgage backed securities there is risk that the impairment of the value of the collateral underlying the security such as non payment of loans will result in a default on interest or principal payments. Credit risk is heightened to the extent the Fund invests in securities rated below A A and equivalent. Asset Backed Securities Risk Credit risk is an important issue in ABS because of the significant credit risks inherent in the underlying collateral and because issuers are primarily private entities. Credit risk arises from losses due to defaults by the borrowers in the underlying collateral or the issuer’s or servicer’s failure to perform. Market risk arises from the cash flow characteristics of the security which for many ABS tend to be predictable. The greatest variability in cash flows comes from credit performance including the presence of early amortization or acceleration features designed to protect the investor if credit losses in the portfolio rise well above expected levels. Interest rate risk arises for the issuer from the relationship between the pricing terms on the underlying collateral and the terms of the rate paid to security holders. ABS also are subject to the risk that a change in interest rates may influence the pace of prepayments of the underlying securities which in turn affects yields on an absolute basis. Liquidity risk can arise from increased perceived credit risk. Illiquidity can also become a significant problem if concerns about credit quality for example lead investors to avoid the securities issued by the relevant special purpose entity. 6 Operations risk arises through the potential for misrepresentation of asset quality or terms by the originating institution misrepresentation of the nature and current value of the assets by the servicer and inadequate controls over disbursements and receipts by the servicer. Structural risk may arise through investments in ABS with structures (for example the establishment of various security tranches) that are intended to reallocate the risks entailed in the underlying collateral (particularly credit risk) in ways that give certain investors less credit risk protection (i.e. a lower priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying pool of assets) than others. As a result such securities have a higher risk of loss as a result of delinquencies or losses on the underlying assets. Management Risk The Fund is actively managed and its success depends upon the investment skills and analytical abilities of the investment adviser to develop and effectively implement strategies that achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Subjective decisions made by the investment adviser may cause the Fund to incur losses or to miss profit opportunities on which it may otherwise have capitalized. U.S. Government Agency Securities Risk Certain U.S. government agency securities are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury while others are supported only by the credit of the issuer or instrumentality. While the U.S. Government has historically provided financial support to U.S. government sponsored agencies or instrumentalities during times of financial stress such as the various actions taken to stabilize the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation during the credit crisis of 2008 no assurance can be given that it will do so in the future. Such securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. 7 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk refers to the price fluctuation of a bond in response to changes in interest rates. The Fund’s investments in bonds and other fixed income securities will change in value in response to fluctuations in interest rates. In general fixed rate bonds with shorter maturities are less sensitive to interest rate movements than those with longer maturities (i.e. when interest rates increase bond prices fall). Rising interest rates tend to cause the prices of debt securities (especially those with longer maturities) to fall which could result in a decrease of the NAV of the Fund. The Fund may invest in variable and floating rate securities. Although these instruments are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than fixed rate instruments the value of variable and floating rate securities may decline if their interest rates do not rise as quickly or as much as general interest rates. The Fund’s fixed income investments may be subject to heightened risk associated with rising interest rates given the current historically low interest rate environment. A rising rate environment may also result in periods of volatility and increased redemptions. As a result of increased redemptions the Fund may have to liquidate fixed income securities at disadvantageous prices and times or at a loss which could adversely affect the performance of the Fund. While the Fund may use futures contracts and futures options to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates there can be no guarantee that the Fund will be able to successfully hedge interest rate exposures. 8 Maturity Risk Interest rate risk as discussed above will generally affect the price of a fixed income security more if the security has a longer maturity. Prepayment Risk The Fund’s investments are subject to the risk that in times of declining interest rates the Fund’s higher yielding securities will be prepaid and the Fund will have to replace them with securities potentially having a lower yield. Mortgage Backed Securities Risk Borrowers may default on their mortgage obligations or the guarantees underlying the mortgage backed securities. In addition during periods of falling interest rates mortgage backed securities may be called or prepaid which may result in the Fund having to reinvest proceeds in other investments at a lower interest rate. A fund holding mortgage related securities may exhibit additional volatility during periods of fluctuating interest rates. Illiquid Investment Risk Illiquid investments subject the Fund to the risk that it may not be able to sell the investments when desired or at favorable prices. The size of a transaction or illiquid markets may be factors. Some loan transactions may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale or may trade infrequently and as a result it may take longer to settle these transactions which may result in impaired value when the Fund needs to liquidate such loans. In addition certain derivative instruments and private placements such as Rule 144A Regulation S and Regulation D securities may be illiquid. Private Placement Risk The Fund may invest in private placement securities that cannot be offered for public resale unless registered under the applicable securities laws or that have a contractual restriction that prohibits or limits their resale. Private placement securities are securities that have not been registered under the 9 applicable securities laws such as Rule 144A securities securities of U.S. and non U.S. issuers that are issued pursuant to Regulation S and securities issued pursuant to Regulation D. Restricted securities may not be listed on an exchange and may have no active trading market resulting in the security being deemed illiquid. Large Shareholder Risk Asset allocation decisions particularly large redemptions made by an investment adviser whose discretionary clients make up a large percentage of the Fund’s shareholders may adversely impact remaining Fund shareholders. Exchange Traded Fund (“ETF”) and Investment Company Risk The Fund may invest in shares of ETFs and other investment companies. Shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the Fund’s expenses and similar expenses of the underlying ETF or investment company when the Fund invests in shares of another investment company or ETF. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with the ETF’s or investment company’s investments. These risks may be similar to the risks of the Fund but may also vary wildly depending on the underlying investment strategy and objectives. ETF’s may be designed to track a particular index if the performance of the underlying securities of the index goes down the investment in the ETF may result in a loss. ETF shares are traded on securities exchanges and may not be traded extensively which may result in larger differences between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. 10 Convertible Securities Risk The Fund may invest in convertible securities which may perform in a similar manner to a regular debt security. Investments in convertible securities are subject to variety of risks including investment risk market risk issuer risk and interest rate risk. A rise in market interest rates may result in the value of a convertible security decreasing. Additionally if an issuer is not able to pay interest or dividends when due their market value of the security may change based on the issuer’s credit rating and the perception of the issuer’s creditworthiness. Convertible securities may also be lower rated securities as they may face higher levels of credit risk. Preferred Securities Risk The Fund may invest in preferred securities which are equity interests in a company that entitle the holder to receive common stock dividends and a fixed share of the proceeds resulting from a liquidation of the company in preference to the holders of other securities. Preferred securities may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return. Preferred securities are subject to issuer specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. In addition a company’s preferred securities may pay dividends only after the company makes required payments on bonds and other debt. If a company experiences actual or perceived changes in its financial condition or prospects the value of preferred securities may be more greatly affected than the value of bonds and other debt. Derivatives Risk Derivatives are financial contracts whose value depends on or is derived from the value of an underlying asset or index. Risks of investing in derivatives are different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. Risks include liquidity risk interest rate risk market risk credit risk risk of mis pricing or improper valuation and the risk of miscorrelation. The Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested. 11 Foreign Investment Risk Investing in securities of foreign based companies involves risks not typically associated with investing in securities of companies organized and operated in the United States. These risks include adverse political social and economic developments abroad different kinds and levels of market and issuer regulations and the different characteristics of overseas economies and markets. These factors can make foreign investments more volatile and potentially less liquid than U.S. investments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund’s portfolio. The risks of investing in foreign securities are heightened in emerging markets. Investment Risk Investors in the Fund could lose money including the possible loss of the entire principal amount of an investment over short or long periods of time. Leverage Risk Leverage can result from borrowing or from an investment in reverse repurchase agreements and in some cases derivative contracts that may result in leverage to the Fund. Leverage risk is created when an investment exposes the Fund to a level of risk that exceeds the amount invested. Leveraging is speculative tends to exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund’s securities and may cause the Fund to be more volatile. 12 Market Risk Market risks including political regulatory economic and social developments can result in market volatility and can affect the value of the fund’s investments. Natural disasters the spread of infectious illness and other public health emergencies recession terrorism and other unforeseeable events may lead to increased market volatility and may have adverse effects on world economies and markets generally. Sovereign Debt Risk Bonds issued by foreign governments sometimes referred to as “sovereign” debt present risks not associated with investments in other types of bonds. The government or agency issuing the debt may be unable or unwilling to make interest payments and or repay the principal owed. In such instance the Fund may have limited recourse against the issuing government or agency.'}, 5: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BBH LIMITED DURATION FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The investment objective of the BBH Limited Duration Fund (the “Fund”) is to provide maximum total return consistent with preservation of capital and prudent investment management.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a well diversified portfolio of durable performing fixed income instruments.

Below Investment Grade Securities (Junk Bonds) Risk Due to uncertainty regarding the ability of the issuer to pay principal and interest securities that are rated below investment grade (i.e. Ba1 BB or lower) and their unrated equivalents may be subject to greater risks than securities which have higher credit ratings including a high risk of default. These securities are considered speculative and are commonly known as “junk bonds.”'}, 6: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BBH INCOME FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The investment objective of the BBH Income Fund (the “Fund”) is to provide maximum total return with an emphasis on current income consistent with preservation of capital and prudent investment management.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'Brown Brothers Harriman Co. (“BBH Co.”) through a separately identifiable department (“Investment Adviser”) serves as the Fund’s investment adviser. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a well diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments including floating or variable rate debt instruments. The Fund intends to invest only in debt instruments which are performing durable and available at an attractive valuation. With respect to fixed income instruments the term “performing” indicates that the instrument is making payment of interest and principal on schedule while the term “durable” signifies the Investment Adviser’s assessment that the obligor responsible for making payment on the instrument is likely to continue making such timely payment in a variety of future economic circumstances. The Investment Adviser considers an instrument to be “attractively valued” when the Investment Adviser believes that the instrument’s potential total return exceeds that which would be normally justified by the instrument’s underlying risks. The Fund’s investments will be primarily focused in notes and bonds issued by domestic and foreign corporations financial institutions the U.S. Government and government agencies and government guaranteed issuers asset backed securities consisting of consumer and commercial asset backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities and loan transactions. The Fund may purchase select municipal obligations sovereign debt and fixed income securities issued by corporations and governments in foreign countries including in emerging markets when the Investment Adviser believes that the additional returns available from these securities are attractive. The Fund may invest in money market instruments repurchase agreements commercial paper and for hedging purposes derivative instruments consisting of futures swaps 5 and options to meet its investment objective. The Fund may also invest a portion of its assets in securities that have characteristics of equity securities including but not limited to convertible securities and preferred stock. Subject to applicable statutory and regulatory limitations the Fund may invest in shares of other investment companies such as exchange traded funds (“ETFs”). The Fund’s investment in other investment companies may include shares of money market funds including funds affiliated with the Investment Adviser. The Fund may invest in fixed and floating rate loan transactions which investments generally will be in the form of loan participations delayed funding loans and revolving credit facilities or assignments of portions of such loans and private placement securities including Rule 144A Regulation S and Regulation D securities. The Fund has no limitations on the range of maturities of the debt securities in which it can invest and may hold securities with short medium or long term maturities. The Fund will seek to maintain an overall portfolio duration (sensitivity to changes in yields) that is consistent with the broad investment grade market through the use of securities held and U.S. Treasury futures. Under normal circumstances the Fund is managed with the intention of maintaining an effective duration of between 80 120 of the effective duration of the Bloomberg US Aggregate Index which as of January 31 2022 was approximately 6.48 years. The Fund also targets under normal circumstances the following exposure limitations at the time of purchase 95 of the Fund’s assets in instruments denominated in U.S. Dollars including securities issued by corporate or sovereign issuers domiciled outside of the U.S. 75 or more of the Fund’s assets in instruments with an investment grade rating 25 or less of the Fund’s assets in 6 instruments rated “BB” (or equivalent) and below which are commonly referred to as “junk bonds” 10 or less of the Fund’s assets in corporate or sovereign debt of issuers domiciled in emerging markets (defined as an issuer in the JPMorgan Emerging Market Bond Index (“JPM EMBI”)) and 5 or less of the Fund’s assets in instruments rated “CCC” (or equivalent) and below. These limitations notwithstanding the Fund will have the flexibility to invest in the sectors industries securities and durations that the Investment Adviser identifies as offering attractive risk adjusted returns consistent with the Fund’s investment objective.

Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the likelihood that an issuer guarantor borrower or the counterparty to a derivative contract or repurchase agreement will default on interest or principal payments. For asset backed and commercial mortgage backed securities there is risk that the impairment of the value of the collateral underlying the security such as non payment of loans will result in default on interest or principal payments. For loan transactions there is risk that the borrower of the loan may or will default or become otherwise unable or unwilling to pay. Additionally loans that have a lower priority in an issuer’s capital structure may involve a higher degree of overall risk than more senior loans. In addition to the possibility of an issuer being in default the issuer may request an extension on the maturity of a security. In instances in which the maturity of a security is extended the value of the security may decline. Issuer Risk The value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that directly relate to the issuer such as management performance financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer’s goods or services. 8 Asset Backed Securities Risk Investments in asset backed securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks as well as risk that the underlying borrower will be unable to meet its obligations. In addition during periods of falling interest rates asset backed securities may be called or prepaid which may result in the Fund having to reinvest proceeds in other investments at a lower interest rate. The ability of an issuer of asset backed securities to enforce its security interest in the underlying assets may be limited. A fund holding asset backed securities may exhibit additional volatility during periods of fluctuating interest rates. Management Risk The Fund is actively managed and its success depends upon the investment skills and analytical abilities of the Investment Adviser to develop and effectively implement strategies that achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Subjective decisions made by the Investment Adviser may cause the Fund to incur losses or to miss profit opportunities on which it may otherwise have capitalized. Prepayment Risk The Fund’s investments are subject to the risk that in times of declining interest rates the Fund’s higher yielding securities will be prepaid and the Fund will have to replace them with securities potentially having a lower yield.

Large Shareholder Risk To the extent that the Fund experiences a large purchase or redemption on any business day the Fund’s performance may be adversely affected. 10 Foreign Investment Risk Investing in securities of foreign based companies involves risks not typically associated with investing in securities of companies organized and operated in the United States. These risks include adverse political social and economic developments abroad different kinds and levels of market and issuer regulations and the different characteristics of overseas economies and markets. These factors can make foreign investments more volatile and potentially less liquid than U.S. investments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund’s portfolio. Sovereign Debt Risk Bonds issued by foreign governments sometimes referred to as “sovereign” debt present risks not associated with investments in other types of bonds. The government or agency issuing the debt may be unable or unwilling to make interest payments and or repay the principal owed. In such instance the Fund may have limited recourse against the issuing government or agency. U.S. Government Agency Securities Risk Certain U.S. government agency securities are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury while others are supported only by the credit of the issuer or instrumentality. While the U.S. Government has historically provided financial support to U.S. government sponsored agencies or instrumentalities during times of financial stress no assurance can be given that it will do so in the future. Such securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Below Investment Grade Securities (Junk Bonds) Risk Due to uncertainty regarding the ability of the issuer to pay principal and interest securities that are rated below investment grade (i.e. Ba1 BB or lower) and their unrated equivalents may be subject to greater risks than securities which have higher credit ratings including a high risk of default. These securities are considered speculative and are commonly known as “junk bonds.” 11 Call Risk If the securities in which the Fund invests are redeemed by the issuer before maturity the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities that pay a lower interest rate. Derivatives Risk Derivatives are financial contracts the value of which depends on or is derived from the value of an underlying asset or index. The risks associated with derivatives are different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. Risks include illiquid investment risk interest rate risk market risk credit risk risk of mis pricing or improper valuation and the risk of miscorrelation. Derivatives also expose the Fund to counterparty risk which is the risk that the derivative counterparty will not fulfill its contractual obligations. The Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested. Emerging Markets Risk Emerging markets involve risks greater than those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign markets. These less developed markets can be subject to greater social economic regulatory and political uncertainties and the price of securities issued by emerging markets issuers can be extremely volatile. Exchange Traded Fund (“ETF”) and Investment Company Risk The Fund may invest in shares of ETFs and other investment companies. Shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the Fund’s expenses and similar expenses of the 12 underlying ETF or investment company when the Fund invests in shares of another investment company or ETF. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with the ETF’s or investment company’s investments. These risks may be similar to the risks of the Fund but may also vary wildly depending on the underlying investment strategy and objectives. ETF’s may be designed to track a particular index if the performance of the underlying securities of the index goes down the investment in the ETF may result in a loss. ETF shares are traded on securities exchanges and may not be traded extensively which may result in larger differences between the “ask” price quoted by a seller and the “bid” price offered by a buyer. Convertible Securities Risk The Fund may invest in convertible securities which may perform in a similar manner to a regular debt security. Investments in convertible securities are subject to a variety of risks including investment risk market risk issuer risk and interest rate risk. A rise in market interest rates may result in the value of a convertible security decreasing. Additionally if an issuer is not able to pay interest or dividends when due the market value of the security may change based on the issuer’s credit rating and the perception of the issuer’s creditworthiness. Convertible securities may also be lower rated securities as they may face higher levels of credit risk. Preferred Securities Risk The Fund may invest in preferred securities which are equity interests in a company that entitle the holder to receive common stock dividends and a fixed share of the proceeds resulting from a liquidation of the company in preference to the holders of other securities. Preferred securities may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return. Preferred securities are subject to issuer specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. In addition a company’s preferred securities may pay dividends only after the company makes required payments on bonds and other debt. If a company 13 experiences actual or perceived changes in its financial condition or prospects the value of preferred securities may be more greatly affected than the value of bonds and other debt. Investment Risk Investors in the Fund could lose money including the possible loss of the entire principal amount of an investment over short or long periods of time. Loan Risk Loan participations delayed funding loans and revolving credit facilities may have the effect of requiring the Fund to increase its investment in a company at a time when it might not otherwise decide to do so. Loan participations delayed funding loans and revolving credit facilities are subject to credit interest rate and liquidity risk and the risks of being a lender. Market Risk The price of a security may fall due to changing economic political regulatory or market conditions or due to a company’s or issuer’s individual situation. Natural disasters the spread of infectious illness and other public health emergencies recession terrorism and other unforeseeable events may lead to increased market volatility and may have adverse effects on world economies and markets generally. 14 Municipal Issuer Risk The Fund may invest in municipal securities. The value of municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities holders in the event of a default or bankruptcy. If a security’s structure fails to function as intended the security could become taxable or decline in value. Additionally issuers of municipal obligations may not be able to make timely payments because of general economic downturns or increased governmental costs. Repurchase Agreement Risk This is the risk that the other party to a repurchase agreement will default on its obligation under the agreement. Sector Risk A significant investment of Fund assets within one or more sectors industries securities and or durations may increase the Fund’s sensitivity to adverse economic business political or other risks associated with such sector industry security or duration.'}, 7: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BBH INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL BOND FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The investment objective of the BBH Intermediate Municipal Bond Fund (the “Fund”) is to protect investor s capital and generate attractive risk adjusted returns.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by applying bottom up fundamental analysis and investing in a long term tax aware manner. The Fund aims to implement the strategy by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of investment grade municipal bonds rated in the four highest credit ratings categories (AAA to BBB or equivalent) at the time of purchase by at least one nationally recognized credit rating agency or if unrated deemed to be of comparable quality by the investment adviser. Under normal circumstances the Fund will invest at least 80 of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in municipal bonds that pay interest that is generally excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes (except that the interest paid by certain municipal securities may be includable in taxable income for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax). There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund may invest in fixed variable or floating rate municipal securities issued by states territories and possessions of the United States and the District of Columbia and their political subdivisions agencies and instrumentalities authorities thereof and multi state agencies issued to obtain funds for various public purposes. These may include general obligation bonds which typically are backed by the issuer’s ability to levy taxes and revenue bonds which typically are backed by a stream of revenue from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue source. Municipal securities also include auction rate municipal 5 securities. The Fund may invest up to 15 of the market value of its total assets in securities that may be purchased on a when issued or delayed delivery basis. The Fund may also invest up to 20 of its total assets in securities that are not municipal securities if in the opinion of the Investment Adviser these securities will enhance after tax returns for Fund investors. Non municipal securities investments may include notes and bonds issued by domestic and foreign corporations and financial institutions and the U.S. Government its agencies and guaranteed issuers. In addition the Fund may purchase asset backed securities mortgage backed securities auction rate securities and other sovereign debt when the Investment Adviser believes that the additional returns from these securities justify the risk of allocations to these asset classes. Under normal circumstances the Fund expects the portfolio’s dollar weighted average maturity to be between 3 and 10 years. The Fund may invest in money market instruments repurchase agreements and derivative instruments including futures swaps and options to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. The Fund will not invest 25 or more of total assets in municipal obligations relating to similar types of projects or with other similar economic business or political characteristics (such as bonds of airport facilities or healthcare providers). For purposes of this policy securities of the U.S. Government its agencies or instrumentalities and municipal obligations backed by the credit of governmental entities are not subject to this 25 limit. The Fund may invest more than 25 of its total assets in municipal securities whose issuers are located in any one state. 6 As part of the Fund’s investment process the Investment Adviser considers environmental social and governance (“ESG”) factors for each investment in the portfolio. ESG factors include but are not limited to the environmental and social impact of the issuer as well as the issuers instituted governance programs.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'The principal risks of investing in the Fund and the circumstances reasonably likely to adversely affect an investment are listed and described below. The share price of the Fund changes daily based on market conditions and other factors. A shareholder may lose money by investing in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Investment Risk Investors in the Fund could lose money including the possible loss of the entire principal amount of an investment over short or even long periods of time. Market Risk The price of a security may fall due to changing economic political regulatory or market conditions or due to a company’s or issuer’s individual situation. Natural disasters the spread of infectious illness and other public health emergencies recession terrorism and other unforeseeable events may lead to increased market volatility and may have adverse effects on world economies and markets generally. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk refers to the price fluctuation of a bond in response to changes in interest rates. The Fund’s investments in bonds and other fixed income securities will change in value in response to fluctuations in interest rates. In general bonds with shorter maturities are less sensitive to interest rate movements than those with longer maturities (i.e. when interest rates increase 7 bond prices fall). Rising interest rates tend to cause the prices of debt securities (especially those with longer maturities) to fall which could result in a decrease of the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund. Changes in the yield curve will impact the Fund’s investments. For example when transitioning to recession yields on shorter term securities tend to fall faster than the yields on longer term securities. When transitioning to expansion yields on longer term bonds tend to rise less quickly that yields on shorter term securities. The Fund may invest in variable and floating rate securities. Although these instruments are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than fixed rate instruments the value of variable and floating rate securities may decline if their interest rates do not rise as quickly or as much as general interest rates. The Fund’s fixed income investments may be subject to heightened risk associated with rising interest rates given the current historically low interest rate environment. A potential increase in interest rates may also result in periods of volatility and increased redemptions. As a result of increased redemptions the Fund may have to liquidate fixed income securities at disadvantageous prices and times or at a loss which could adversely affect the performance of the Fund. While the Fund may use futures contracts swaps and futures options to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates there can be no guarantee that the Fund will be able to successfully hedge interest rate exposures. Illiquid Investment Risk Illiquid investment risk exists when a particular instrument is difficult to purchase or sell. Size of a transaction or illiquid markets may be factors. 8 Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the likelihood that an issuer guarantor or the counterparty to a derivative contract or repurchase agreement will default on interest or principal payments. In addition to the possibility of an issuer being in default the issuer may request an extension on the maturity of a security. In instances in which the maturity of a security is extended the value of the security may decline. Municipal Issuer Risk The Fund invests principally in municipal securities. The value of municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities holders in the event of a default or bankruptcy. If a security’s structure fails to function as intended the security could become taxable or decline in value. Additionally issuers of municipal obligations may not be able to make timely payments because of general economic downturns or increased governmental costs. Municipal Revenue Sector Risk The Fund will not invest 25 or more of its total assets in any one municipal revenue sector relating to bonds backed by revenues from similar types of projects (such as those relating to higher education healthcare housing airports or utilities) or with other similar economic business or political characteristics. However as the Fund’s exposure to such similar projects increases the Fund will also become more sensitive to adverse economic business or political developments relevant to these projects. Geographic Risk From time to time the Fund may have a significant position in municipal securities whose issuers are located in a particular state. Under these circumstances changes in the economic conditions in that state are likely to affect the Fund’s investments and performance. 9 Taxation Risk The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has announced that holders of tax exempt bonds such as the Fund have certain risks if the bonds were issued in connection with abusive transactions refinancing irregularities or the misuse of proceeds from the bond offering. While the Fund endeavors to purchase only bona fide tax exempt bonds there is a risk that a bond may be reclassified by the IRS as a taxable bond creating taxable income for the Fund and its shareholders. In this case the Fund might be required to send to you and file with the IRS information returns for prior calendar years reclassifying some of its exempt interest dividends as taxable dividends. To qualify to pay exempt interest dividends which are treated as items of interest excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes at least 50 of the value of the total assets of the Fund must consist of obligations exempt from regular income tax as of the close of each quarter of the Fund’s taxable year. If the proportion of taxable investments held by the Fund exceeds 50 of the Fund’s total assets as of the close of any quarter of any Fund taxable year the Fund will not for that taxable year satisfy the general eligibility test that otherwise permits it to pay exempt interest dividends. Additionally the Fund is generally not a suitable investment for individual retirement accounts for other tax exempt or tax deferred accounts or for investors who are not sensitive to the federal income tax consequences of their investments. 10 When Issued and Delayed Delivery Securities Risk The fund will not invest more than 15 of the market value of its total assets less liabilities other than the obligations created by when issued or delayed delivery commitments in securities that have an extended settlement including when issued and delayed delivery securities. Between the transaction date and the delivery date the price of the securities is subject to market fluctuations and may rise or fall depending on market conditions additionally no interest will accrue until the securities are delivered. If a fund remains substantially fully invested at a time when a purchase is outstanding the purchases may result in a form of leverage. If the counterparty to a when issued or delayed delivery transaction fails to deliver the securities the fund may receive a less favorable price or yield or may suffer a loss. Large Shareholder Risk Asset allocation decisions particularly large redemptions made by an investment adviser whose discretionary clients make up a large percentage of the Fund’s shareholders may adversely impact remaining Fund shareholders. Management Risk The Fund is actively managed and its success depends upon the investment skills and analytical abilities of the Investment Adviser to develop and effectively implement strategies that achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Subjective decisions made by the Investment Adviser may cause the Fund to incur losses or to miss profit opportunities on which it may otherwise have capitalized. Call Risk If the securities in which the Fund invests are redeemed by the issuer before maturity the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities that pay a lower interest rate which may decrease the Fund’s yield. This will most likely happen when interest rates are declining. 11 Derivatives Risk Derivatives are financial contracts whose value depends on or is derived from the value of an underlying asset or index. Risks are different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. Risks include illiquid investment risk interest rate risk market risk credit risk risk of mis pricing or improper valuation and the risk of miscorrelation. The Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested.'}, 8: {'mutual_fund_name': 'BBH U.S. GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND', 'investment_objective': 'The investment objective of the BBH U.S. Government Money Market Fund (the “Fund”) is to provide investors with as high a level of income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'Under normal circumstances the Fund invests at least 99.5 of its total assets in cash and short term U.S. Treasury securities and securities issued by U.S. government agencies or government sponsored enterprises and repurchase agreements fully collateralized by such instruments. Additionally under normal circumstances at least 80 of the value of the Fund’s net assets will be invested in U.S. government securities and repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. government securities. At the time of purchase a portfolio investment must present minimal credit risk in accordance with procedures adopted by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) and pursuant to certain factors prescribed by Rule 2a 7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”). These investments may have fixed floating or variable rates of interest. In pursuing its investment objective and implementing its investment strategies the Fund will comply with Rule 2a 7 under the 1940 Act. Brown Brothers Harriman Co. (“BBH Co.”) through a separately identifiable department (the “Investment Adviser”) serves as the Fund’s investment adviser. In selecting securities the Investment Adviser seeks to maximize current income within the limits of the Fund’s credit maturity and diversification policies. Some of these policies may be stricter than required by applicable federal regulation. As a U.S. government money market fund in order to preserve the value of investors’ capital the Fund seeks to maintain a stable 1.00 net asset value (“NAV”) per share price.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'The principal risks of investing in the Fund and the circumstances reasonably likely to adversely affect an investment are listed and described below. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Stable NAV Risk This is the risk that the Fund will not be able to maintain a NAV per share of 1.00 at all times. Market Risk The price of a security may fall due to changing economic political regulatory or market conditions or due to a company’s or issuer’s individual situation. Natural disasters the spread of infectious illness and other public health emergencies recession terrorism and other unforeseeable events may lead to increased market volatility and may have adverse effects on world economies and markets generally. Interest Rate Risk This is the risk associated with the price fluctuation of a security in response to changes in interest rates and the possibility that the Fund’s yield may decline if interest rates decline. Repurchase Agreement Risk This is the risk that the other party to a repurchase agreement will default on its obligation under the agreement. 5 U.S. Government Agency Securities Risk Certain U.S. government agency securities are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury while others are supported only by the credit of the issuer or instrumentality. In the case of securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States it may not be possible to assert a claim against the United States itself in the event the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the security for ultimate repayment does not meet its commitments. Such securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Variable and Floating Rate Instrument Risk The absence of an active market for these securities could make it difficult for the Fund to dispose of them if the issuer defaults. Regulatory Risk The SEC and other regulators may adopt additional money market fund regulations in the future which may impact the operation and performance of the Fund. Large Shareholder Risk This is the risk that asset allocation decisions particularly large redemptions made by BBH Co. whose discretionary investment advisory clients make up a large percentage of the Fund’s shareholders may adversely impact remaining Fund shareholders. 6 Management Risk This is the risk that the securities selected by the Investment Adviser will underperform the markets the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. Credit Risk Credit risk refers to the likelihood that an issuer guarantor or counterparty to a debt obligation will default on interest or principal payments. You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at 1.00 per share it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of BBH Co. and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) or any other government agency. Additionally BBH Co. as the Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund and you should not expect that BBH Co. will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.'}}\n",

REITs are corporations or trusts that invest primarily in fee or leasehold ownership of real estate mortgages or shares issued by other REITs and that receive favorable tax treatment provided they meet certain conditions including the requirement that they distribute at least 90 of their taxable income.Holdings are typically sold to make room in the portfolio for more attractive stocks or where the holding reaches the Adviser’s estimate for its intrinsic value or in response to an unexpected negative fundamental change including a change in management’s strategic direction.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. In addition to not achieving your investment goals you could lose all or a portion of your investment in the Fund over short or even long periods of time. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are General Market Risk. The Fund’s net asset value and investment return will fluctuate based upon changes in the value of its portfolio securities. Certain securities selected for the Fund’s portfolio may be worth less than the price originally paid for them or less than they were worth at an earlier time. Management Risk. The Fund may not meet its investment objective or may underperform the market or other mutual funds with similar investment strategies if the Adviser cannot successfully implement the Fund’s investment strategies. Equity Securities Risk. The equity securities held in the Fund’s portfolio may experience sudden unpredictable drops in value or long periods of decline in value. This may occur because of factors that affect securities markets generally or factors affecting specific industries sectors geographic markets or companies in which the Fund invests.Large Cap Companies Risk. The Fund’s investment in larger companies is subject to the risk that larger companies are sometimes unable to attain the high growth rates of successful smaller companies especially during extended periods of economic expansion. REIT Risk. The real estate industry has been subject to substantial fluctuations and declines on a local regional and national basis in the past and may continue to be in the future. Also the value of a REIT can be hurt by economic downturns or by changes in real estate values rents property taxes interest rates tax treatment regulations or the legal structure of a real estate investment trust.Foreign Securities Risk. Investments in securities of foreign issuers involve risks not ordinarily associated with investments in securities and instruments of U.S. issuers including risks relating to political social and economic developments abroad differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory and accounting requirements tax risks and market practices as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies. There may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about a U.S. company and many foreign companies are not subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards regulatory framework and practices comparable to those in the U.S.Emerging Markets Risk. Emerging markets are markets of countries in the initial stages of industrialization and that generally have low per capita income. In addition to the risks of foreign securities in general emerging markets are generally more volatile have relatively unstable governments social and legal systems that do not protect shareholders economies based on only a few industries and securities markets that are substantially smaller less liquid and more volatile with less government oversight than more developed countries.Frontier Market Countries Risk. Frontier market countries generally have smaller economies and even less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets and as a result the risks of investing in emerging market countries are magnified in frontier market countries. The magnification of risks are the result of potential for extreme price volatility and illiquidity in frontier markets government ownership or control of parts of the private sector and of certain companies trade barriers exchange controls managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which frontier market countries trade and the relatively new and unsettled securities laws in many frontier market countries.'}, 3: {'mutual_fund_name': 'Jackson Square SMID Cap Growth Fund', 'investment_objective': 'The Jackson Square SMID Cap Growth Fund (the “Fund” or the “SMID Cap Growth Fund”) seeks long term capital appreciation.', 'principal_investment_strategies': 'The Fund is non diversified and invests primarily in common stocks of growth oriented companies that the Adviser believes have long term capital appreciation potential and may grow faster than the U.S. economy. Under normal circumstances the Fund invests at least 80 of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities issued by small and mid capitalization companies. This investment policy can be changed by the Fund upon 60 days’ prior written notice to shareholders.', 'principal_investment_risks': 'An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.
